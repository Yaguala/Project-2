In her early life, Bardot was an aspiring ballet dancer. She started her acting career in 1952 and, after appearing in 16 films, became world-famous due to her role in her then-husband Roger Vadim's controversial film And God Created Woman. She later starred in Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 cult film, Contempt. She was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress for her role in Louis Malle's 1965 film, Viva Maria!.

She caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of Simone de Beauvoir's 1959 essay, The Lolita Syndrome, which described Bardot as a ""locomotive of women's history"" and built upon existentialist themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France.

Bardot retired from the entertainment industry in 1973. During her career in show business Bardot starred in 47 films, performed in numerous musical shows, and recorded 80 songs. She was awarded the Légion d'honneur in 1985 but refused to receive it.

After her retirement, Bardot established herself as an animal rights activist. During the 1990s, she became controversial due to her criticism of immigration, Islamization and Islam in France, and has been fined five times for ""inciting racial hatred"".",1934-09-28,,3783.0,Acting,"Paris, France",3.8575,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//prEu5JJslUBTjOSAxsO9VU4OoYq.jpg

With a career spanning five decades, she is often regarded as one of the most influential screen figures in cinematic history.

According to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, upon her arrival in the U.S. Bergman quickly became ""the ideal of American womanhood"" and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress. David O. Selznick once called her ""the most completely conscientious actress"" he had ever worked with. In 1999, the American Film Institute recognised Bergman as the fourth greatest female screen legend of Classic Hollywood Cinema.

She won numerous accolades, including three Academy Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, four Golden Globe Awards, BAFTA Award and a Volpi Cup. She is one of only four actresses to have received at least three acting Academy Awards (only Katharine Hepburn has four).

Born in Stockholm to a Swedish father and a German mother, Bergman began her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to the U.S. audience came in the English-language remake of Intermezzo (1939). Known for her naturally luminous beauty, she starred in Casablanca (1942) as Ilsa Lund, her most famous role, opposite Humphrey Bogart. Bergman's notable performances in the 1940s include the dramas For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Gaslight (1944), The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), and Joan of Arc (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress; she won for Gaslight. She made three films with Alfred Hitchcock: Spellbound (1945), with Gregory Peck, Notorious (1946), opposite Cary Grant and Under Capricorn (1949), alongside Joseph Cotten.

In 1950, she starred in Roberto Rossellini's Stromboli, released after the revelation she was having an affair with Rossellini; that and her pregnancy prior to their marriage created a scandal in the U.S. that prompted her to remain in Europe for several years. During this time she starred in Rossellini's Europa '51 and Journey to Italy (1954), now critically acclaimed, the former of which won her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. She had a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in Anastasia (1956), winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress. Soon after, she co-starred with Grant in the romance Indiscreet (1958). In 1969, she starred in the acclaimed and highly successful film Cactus Flower. In later years, Bergman won her third Academy Award, this one for Best Supporting Actress, for her role in Murder on the Orient Express (1974). In 1978, she starred in Ingmar Bergman's (no relation) Swedish Autumn Sonata receiving her sixth Best Actress nomination. Bergman spoke five languages – Swedish, English, German, Italian and French – and acted in each.

In her final role, she portrayed the late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir in the television miniseries A Woman Called Golda (1982) for which she posthumously won her second Emmy Award for Best Actress.

Welch first garnered attention for her role in Fantastic Voyage (1966), after which she signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox. They lent her contract to the British studio Hammer Film Productions, for whom she made One Million Years B.C. (1966). Although Welch had only three lines of dialogue in the film, images of her in the doe-skin bikini became bestselling posters that turned her into an international sex symbol. She later starred in Bedazzled (1967), Bandolero! (1968), 100 Rifles (1969), Myra Breckinridge (1970), Hannie Caulder (1971), Kansas City Bomber (1972), The Last of Sheila (1973), The Three Musketeers (1973), The Wild Party (1975), and Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976). She made several television variety specials.

Through her portrayal of strong female characters, helping her break the mold of the traditional sex symbol, Welch developed a unique film persona that made her an icon of the 1960s and 1970s. Her rise to stardom in the mid-1960s was partly credited with ending Hollywood's vigorous promotion of the blonde bombshell.[1][2][3] Her love scene with Jim Brown in 100 Rifles also made cinematic history with their portrayal of interracial intimacy.[4] She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical or Comedy in 1974 for her performance as Constance Bonacieux in The Three Musketeers and reprised the role in its sequel the following year. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Television Film for her performance in Right to Die (1987). Her final film was How to Be a Latin Lover (2017). In 1995, Welch was chosen by Empire magazine as one of the ""100 Sexiest Stars in Film History"". Playboy ranked Welch No. 3 on their ""100 Sexiest Stars of the Twentieth Century"" list.

His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate association's middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels.

In 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career. Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels, Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) kickboxing record, and a semi-contact record of 41-4.  He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981, van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave van Damme a small role in the movie Missing in Action (1984), but it wasn't good enough to get anybody's attention. In 1984, he got his first significant role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie, No Retreat, No Surrender (1986). Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Bloodsport (1988). The movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if van Damme did not help them to re-cut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the US shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a US box-office hit in the spring of 1988.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet was born in Roanne, Loire, France. He bought his first camera at the age of 17 and made short films while studying animation at Cinémation Studios. He befriended Marc Caro, a designer and comic book artist who became his longtime collaborator and co-director. They met at an animation festival in Annecy in 1974.

Together, Jeunet and Caro directed award-winning animations. Their first live action film was The Bunker of the Last Gunshots (1981), a short film about soldiers in a bleak futuristic world. Jeunet also directed numerous advertisements and music videos, such as Jean Michel Jarre's Zoolook (together with Caro).

Jeunet's films often resonate with the late twentieth century French film movement, cinéma du look, and allude to themes and aesthetics involving German expressionism, French poetic realism, and the French New Wave.

Jeunet and Caro's first feature film was Delicatessen (1991), a melancholy comedy set in a famine-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.

They next made The City of Lost Children (1995), a dark, multi-layered fantasy film about a mad scientist who steals children's dreams so that he can live indefinitely.[3] The success of The City of Lost Children led to an invitation to direct the fourth film in the Alien series, Alien: Resurrection (1997). This is where Jeunet and Caro ended up going their separate ways as Jeunet believed this to be an amazing opportunity and Caro was not interested in a film that lacked creative control working on a big-budget Hollywood movie. Caro ended up assisting for a few weeks, with costumes and set design but afterwards, decided to work on a solo career in illustration and computer graphics.

Jeunet directed Amélie (2001), starring Audrey Tautou. Amélie is the story of a woman who takes pleasure in doing good deeds but has trouble finding love herself, was a huge critical and commercial success worldwide and was nominated for several Academy Awards. For this film, Jeunet also gained a European Film Award for Best Director.

Jeunet has also directed numerous commercials including a 2'25"" film for Chanel N° 5 featuring his frequent collaborator Audrey Tautou.

Angelopoulos' work, described by Martin Scorsese as that of ""a masterful filmmaker"", is characterized by slightest movement, slightest change in distance, long takes, and complex yet carefully composed scenes; his cinematic method, as a result, is often described as ""sweeping"" and ""hypnotic.""

In 1998 his film Eternity and a Day went on to win the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 51st edition of the Cannes Film Festival, and his films have been shown at many of the world's most esteemed film festivals.

Antonelli was born Laura Antonaz in Pola, Kingdom of Italy (in Croatian, Pula), former capital of Istria. After the war, her parents fled what was then Yugoslavia, lived in Italian refugee camps and eventually settled in Naples, where her father found work as a hospital administrator. Antonelli had a childhood interest in mathematics, but as a teenager, she became proficient at gymnastics. In an interview for The New York Times, she recalled, ""My parents had made me take hours of gym classes during my teens ... They felt I was ugly, clumsy, insignificant and they hoped I would at least develop some grace. I became very good, especially in rhythmical gym, which is a kind of dance.""

Setting aside ambitions to make a career in mathematics, she graduated as a gymnastics instructor. She moved to Rome, where she became a secondary-school gym teacher and was able to meet people in the entertainment industry, who helped her find modelling jobs.

Antonelli's earliest engagements included Italian advertisements for Coca-Cola. In 1965, she made her first feature-film appearance in Le sedicenni, although her performance went uncredited. Her American debut came in 1966 in Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs. Other roles followed; her breakthrough came in 1973's Malizia. She appeared in a number of sex farces such as Till Marriage Do Us Part/Mio Dio come sono caduta in basso!.

She worked in more serious films, as well, including Luchino Visconti's last film, The Innocent (1976). In Wifemistress, a romance film of 1977, she played a repressed wife experiencing a sexual awakening. Later, she appeared in Passione d'Amore (1981). From 1986 she mostly worked on Italian television series. Antonelli's final film role was in the sequel Malizia 2000 (1991), following which she retired. She won the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Award, Nastro d'Argento, in 1974 for Malizia.

Antonelli was married to publisher Enrico Piacentini but they divorced. From 1972 to 1980, she was the companion of actor Jean-Paul Belmondo.

On 27 April 1991, cocaine was found during a police raid on Antonelli's home. She was subsequently convicted of possession and dealing and sentenced to house arrest. She spent ten years appealing the conviction, which was eventually overturned. In 2006, the Italian court of appeals ruled in favor of Antonelli and ordered the Ministry of Justice to pay the actress 108,000 euros.

Antonelli died on 22 June 2015, aged 73, from a heart attack.

Her first major role was in Chabrol's film Les Cousins (1959). She has since appeared in most of Chabrol's films. Some of the more noteworthy of his films Audran has appeared in are Les Bonnes Femmes (1960), La Femme Infidèle (1968), Les Biches (1968) as a rich lesbian who becomes involved in a ménage à trois (she first gained notice in this), Le Boucher (1970) as a school teacher who falls in love with a murderous butcher, Juste Avant La Nuit (1971), and Violette Nozière (1978). She won the Silver Bear for Best Actress for her role in Les Biches at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival.

She also appeared in the first film of Éric Rohmer (Signe du Lion), and in films by Jean Delannoy (La Peau de Torpedo), Gabriel Axel (Babette's Feast, as the mysterious cook, Babette), Bertrand Tavernier (Coup de Torchon, as the wife of the cop turned serial killer) and Samuel Fuller (The Big Red One). The most celebrated of her non-Chabrol films was Luis Buñuel's Oscar-winning Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie (1972) as Alice Senechal. Also appearing in English-language productions, Audran has appeared in American features like The Black Bird (1975), and in TV serials like Brideshead Revisited (1981), Mistral's Daughter (1984) and The Sun Also Rises (1984).

Audran won a French César Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance in Violette Nozière (1978) and British Film Academy award for Just Before Nightfall (1975).

She earned the title of Miss France Monde (the French representative of Miss World) and was also the first runner-up in the 1958 Miss World contest.

Auger was born in Paris, France. She made her film debut when still in school.

When she was 18, she married the 43-year-old writer-director Pierre Gaspard-Huit (the couple later divorced). He cast her in several films, including Le Masque de fer (1962) and Kali Yug: Goddess of Vengeance (1963).

When she was on holiday in Nassau, writer-producer Kevin McClory saw Auger and recommended that she audition for his film Thunderball (1965). The role of Domino was originally to be an Italian woman, Dominetta Petacchi. Auger impressed the producers so much that they rewrote the part to that of a French woman, to better suit her. Although she took lessons to perfect her English, her voice was eventually dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl.

Jean-Marc Barr (born on 27 September 1960 in Bitburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) is a French-American film actor and director. His mother is French. His American father was in the US Air Force and served in the Second World War. Jean-Marc Barr is primarily known as an actor, but is also a film director, screenwriter and producer. Barr is bilingual in French and English: he speaks French with a nasal, hybrid accent, reminiscent of his American upbringing - with a slight American accent and occasional anglicisms in interviews - and English with a Mid-Atlantic accent.

He studied philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, the Paris Conservatoire and the Sorbonne. He went on to pursue an education in drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. In London he met his future wife, a pianist and composer Irina Dečermić.

Jean-Marc Barr began working in theatre in France in 1986. After some television roles and film work, in particular, Hope and Glory (1987) by John Boorman, he was cast in the tremendously successful The Big Blue (1988). Luc Besson cast him in the role of French diver Jacques Mayol. He played in the role opposite Rosanna Arquette and Jean Reno. The Big Blue was the most financially successful film in France in the 1980s.

In 1991, he starred in Danish director Lars von Trier's Europa, marking the beginning of a long friendship (he is the godfather of von Trier's children) as well as a significant professional relationship. He went on to appear in von Trier’s Europa (1991), Breaking the Waves (1996), Dancer in the Dark (2000), Dogville (2004) and Manderlay (2005). Also in 2005 he starred in the French film Crustacés et Coquillages.

His collaboration with von Trier put him on track to start directing his own work. He debuted in 1999 as a director, screenwriter and producer with the intimate love story Lovers. This film became the first part of a trilogy; the two subsequent parts being the drama Too Much Flesh (2000) and the comedy Being Light (2001) which he co-directed with Pascal Arnold.

He may also be recognized for his role as the attractive divorce lawyer, Maitre Bertram in the Merchant Ivory film le Divorce (2003). He appeared as Hugo in The Red Siren in 2002. He appeared as the main character in the video for Blur's 1995 single, ""Charmless Man"".

Born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, west of Paris, Belmondo did not perform well in school, but developed a passion for boxing and football. Belmondo made his amateur boxing debut on 10 May 1949 in Paris, France, when he knocked out Rene DesMarais in one round. Belmondo's boxing career was undefeated, but brief. He won three straight first round knockout victories from 1949 to 1950.

His breakthrough role was in Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (1960), which made him a major figure in the French New Wave. Later he acted in Jean-Pierre Melville's philosophical movie Leon Morin, Priest (1961) and in Melville's film noir crime film The Fingerman (Le Doulos, 1963) and Godard again with Pierrot le fou (1965). With That Man From Rio (1965) he switched to commercial, mainstream productions, mainly comedies and action films but did appear in the title role of Alain Resnais' masterpiece Stavisky (1974), which some critics regard as Belmondo's finest performance.

Until the mid-1980s, when he ceased to be one of France's biggest box-office stars, Belmondo's typical characters were either dashing adventurers or more cynical heroes. As he grew older, Belmondo preferred concentrating on his stage work, where he encountered success. He suffered a stroke in 2001 and had since been absent from the stage and the screen until 2009 when he appeared in Un homme et son chien (A man and his dog) which was his last performance.

Belmondo died on 6 September 2021 at his home in Paris, after a period of ill health, at the age of 88.

She went on to appear in the Hollywood films Blindfold (1965), Lost Command (1966), The Professionals (1966), Don't Make Waves (1967) with Tony Curtis, The Hell with Heroes (1968), and the Sergio Leone Western Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), a joint US-Italian production, in which she was praised for her role as a former prostitute opposite Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, and Henry Fonda.

Jaded with the Hollywood film industry and not wanting to become a cliché, Cardinale returned to Italian and French cinema, and garnered the David di Donatello for Best Actress award for her roles in Il giorno della civetta (1968) and as a prostitute alongside Alberto Sordi in A Girl in Australia (1971). In 1974, Cardinale met director Pasquale Squitieri, who would become her partner, and she frequently featured in his films, including I guappi (1974), Corleone (1978) and Claretta (1984), the last of which won her the Nastro d'Argento Award for Best Actress. In 1982, she starred in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo as the love interest of Klaus Kinski, who raises the funds to buy a steamship in Peru. In 2010, Cardinale received the Best Actress Award at the 47th Antalya ""Golden Orange"" International Film Festival for her performance as an elderly Italian woman who takes in a young Turkish exchange student in Signora Enrica.

Outspoken on women's rights causes over the years, Cardinale has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador for the Defense of Women's Rights since March 2000. In February 2011, the Los Angeles Times Magazine named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history.

Like his colleagues and contemporaries Godard, Truffaut, Rohmer and Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cinéma before beginning his career as a film maker.

Chabrol's career began with Le Beau Serge (1958), inspired by Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in Les Biches (1968), La Femme Infidèle (1969) and Le Boucher (1970) — all featuring his then-wife, Stéphane Audran.

Sometimes characterized as a ""mainstream"" New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozière. On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary (1991) and La Ceremonie (1996).

Farrow is also known for her extensive work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, which includes humanitarian activities in Darfur, Chad, and the Central African Republic. In 2008, Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.

The eldest daughter of Australian director John Farrow and Irish actress Maureen O'Sullivan, Farrow had a strict Catholic upbringing in Beverly Hills, California. After working as a fashion model during her teenage years, she first gained notice for her role as Allison MacKenzie in the television soap opera Peyton Place (1964–1966). Her credited feature film debut in Guns at Batasi (1964) earned her a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, and she gained further recognition for her subsequent two-year marriage to Frank Sinatra, whom she married at age 21.

Forman was an important figure in the Czechoslovak New Wave. Film scholars and Czechoslovak authorities saw his 1967 film The Firemen's Ball as a biting satire on Eastern European Communism. The film was initially shown in theatres in his home country in the more reformist atmosphere of the Prague Spring. However, it was later banned by the Communist government after the invasion by the Warsaw Pact countries in 1968. Forman was subsequently forced to leave Czechoslovakia for the United States, where he continued making films, gaining wider critical and financial success. In 1975, he directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) starring Jack Nicholson as a patient in a mental institution. The film received widespread acclaim, and was the second in history to win all five major Academy Awards: Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor in Leading Role, and Actress in Leading Role.

In 1978, he directed the anti-war musical Hair which premiered at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival. In 1981, he directed the turn of the century drama film, Ragtime, which was known for its large ensemble cast. The film went on to receive 8 Academy Award nominations. His next feature was a period biographical film, Amadeus (1984), based on the life of famed classical musician Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart starring Tom Hulce, and F. Murray Abraham. The film was both a critical and financial success earning 11 nominations with 8 wins including for Best Picture, and another win for Forman as Best Director. In 1996, Forman received another Academy Award nomination for Best Director for The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996).

Throughout Forman's career he won 2 Academy Awards, 3 Golden Globe Awards, Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, a British Academy Film Award, a César Award, David di Donatello Award, and the Czech Lion.

His film ""The Silent World"" won the Palme d'Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, although he was not credited at the ceremony with the award instead being presented to the film's co-director Jacques Cousteau. Later in his career he was nominated multiple times for Academy Awards. Malle is also one of the few directors to have won the Golden Lion multiple times.

Malle worked in both French cinema and Hollywood, and he produced both French and English language films. His most famous films include the crime film ""Elevator to the Gallows"" (1958), the World War II drama ""Lacombe, Lucien"" (1974), the romantic crime film ""Atlantic City"" (1980), the comedy-drama ""My Dinner with Andre"" (1981), and the autobiographical film ""Au Revoir les Enfants"" (1987).

Malle was born into a wealthy industrialist family in Thumeries, Nord, France. He initially studied political science at Sciences Po before turning to film studies at IDHEC instead.

He assisted Robert Bresson on ""A Man Escaped"" (1956) before making his first feature, ""Elevator to the Gallows"" (1958), a taut thriller featuring an original score by Miles Davis, which made an international film star of Jeanne Moreau, at the time a leading stage actress of the Comédie-Française. Malle was 24 years old.

Malle's ""The Lovers"" (1958), which also starred Moreau, caused major controversy due to its sexual content, leading to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case regarding the legal definition of obscenity.  Malle is sometimes associated with the nouvelle vague movement, and while Malle's work does not directly fit in with or correspond to the auteurist theories that apply to the work of Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol, Rohmer and others, and he had nothing whatsoever to do with the Cahiers du cinéma, his films do exemplify many of the characteristics of the movement, such as using natural light and shooting on location, and his film ""Zazie dans le Métro"" (1960), an adaptation of the Raymond Queneau novel, inspired Truffaut to write an enthusiastic letter to Malle.

In 1968 Malle visited India and made a seven-part documentary series ""Phantom India"" (1969), which was released in cinemas. Concentrating on real India, its rituals and festivities, Malle fell afoul of the Indian government, which disliked his portrayal of the country, in its fascination with the pre-modern, and consequently banned the BBC from filming in India for several years. Malle later claimed his documentary on India was his favorite film.

Malle later moved to the United States and continued to direct there. Just as his earlier films such as ""The Lovers"" helped popularize French films in the United States, ""My Dinner with Andre"" was at the forefront of the rise of American independent cinema in the 1980s.",1932-10-30,1995-11-23,15389.0,Directing,"Thumeries, Nord, France",3.1429,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//8BKM2iXcr4b8pvx1OOcNsO9wADn.jpg

Berri won the ""Best Film"" BAFTA for Jean de Florette, and was also nominated for twelve César Awards, though he never won.

Internationally, however, two films in 1986 overshadow all his other achievements. Jean de Florette and its sequel Manon des Sources were huge hits. In 1991, his film Uranus was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. Six years later, his film Lucie Aubrac was entered into the 47th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 2003, he was elected President of the Cinémathèque Française where he obtained enough state subsidies to cover the costs of its resurgence at its new site in the rue de Bercy.

Berri's wife, Anne-Marie Rassam, committed suicide in 1997, jumping from the apartment of Isabelle Adjani's mother. Berri and Rassam had two children: actor Julien Rassam and actor and film producer Thomas Langmann.

Berri died of a stroke, in Paris, aged 74. After his death, a group of nine works by Robert Ryman, Ad Reinhardt, Giorgio Morandi, Richard Serra and Lucio Fontana was promised to the Centre Pompidou in Paris in lieu of tax. But the heirs of the film director finally sold them through French art dealer Philippe Ségalot for about €50 million to Qatar.

Marc Caro, born April 2, 1956, is a French filmmaker and cartoonist, best known for his co-directing projects with Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The two of them met at an animation festival in Annecy in 1974.  Together, Jeunet and Caro directed award-winning animations. Their first live action film was The Bunker of the Last Gunshots (1981), a short film about soldiers in a bleak futuristic world.  Jeunet and Caro's first feature film was Delicatessen (1991), a melancholy comedy set in a famine-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.

They next made The City of Lost Children (1995), a dark, multi-layered fantasy film about a mad scientist who steals children's dreams so that he can live indefinitely.

The success of The City of Lost Children led to an invitation to direct the fourth film in the Alien series, Alien: Resurrection (1997). This is where Jeunet and Caro ended up going their separate ways as Jeunet believed this to be an amazing opportunity and Caro was not interested in a film that lacked creative control working on a big-budget Hollywood movie. Caro ended up assisting for a few weeks, with costumes and set design but afterwards, decided to work on a solo career in illustration and computer graphics.

His first feature film as a solo director was entitled Dante 01.

He is considered one of the greatest Italian actors, whose career includes both important productions as well as dozens of divertissements.

Gassman's debut was in Milan, in 1942, with Alda Borelli in Niccodemi's La Nemica (theatre). He then moved to Rome and acted at the Teatro Eliseo joining Tino Carraro and Ernesto Calindri in a team that remained famous for some time; with them he acted in a range of plays from bourgeois comedy to sophisticated intellectual theatre. In 1946, he made his film debut in Preludio d'amore, while only one year later he appeared in five films. In 1948 he played in Riso amaro.

It was with Luchino Visconti's company that Gassman achieved his mature successes, together with Paolo Stoppa, Rina Morelli and Paola Borboni. He played Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams' Un tram che si chiama desiderio (A Streetcar Named Desire), as well as in Come vi piace (As You Like It) by Shakespeare and Oreste (by Vittorio Alfieri). He joined the Teatro Nazionale with Tommaso Salvini, Massimo Girotti, Arnoldo Foà to create a successful Peer Gynt (by Henrik Ibsen). With Luigi Squarzina in 1952 he co-founded and co-directed the Teatro d'Arte Italiano, producing the first complete version of Hamlet in Italy, followed by rare works such as Seneca's Thyestes and Aeschylus's The Persians.

In cinema, he worked frequently both in Italy and abroad. He met and fell in love with American actress Shelley Winters while she was touring Europe with fiancé Farley Granger. When Winters was forced to return to Hollywood to fulfill contractual obligations, he followed her there and married her. With his natural charisma and his fluency in English he scored a number of roles in Hollywood, including Rhapsody with Elizabeth Taylor and The Glass Wall before returning to Italy and the theatre.

On 29 June 2000, Gassman died of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Rome at the age of 77. He was buried at Campo Verano.

Born at Luzarches in Val-d'Oise, Autant-Lara was educated in France and at London's Mill Hill School during his mother's exile as a pacifist. Early in his career, he worked as an art director and costume designer, his best-known work in this vein was possibly for Nana (1926), a silent film directed by Jean Renoir. Autant-Lara also acted in the film.

As a director, he frequently created provocative movies, saying ""if a film does not have venom, it is worthless"". In the 1960s, he turned his back on the New Wave movement, and from then on he had no popular successes.

On 18 June 1989, he came to public notice again, controversially, when he was elected to the European Parliament as a member of the National Front and the oldest member of the assembly. In his maiden speech, in July 1989, he caused a scandal by expressing his ""concerns about the American cultural threat"", provoking a walkout by the majority of the deputies.

In an interview granted to the monthly magazine Globe in September 1989, he accused ex-President of the European Parliament and Holocaust survivor Simone Veil of playing ""ethnic politics"" to try and ""infiltrate and dominate"", saying that ""If they try to speak to me about genocide, I say they missed mother Veil!"" He also described Nazi gas chambers as a ""string of lies"". The resulting scandal led to his resignation as European deputy. Moreover, the members of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, of which he was a vice-president for life, voted to prohibit him from taking his seat thenceforth.

His memoir, The Rage in the Heart, appeared in 1984. He died at Antibes in Alpes-Maritimes in 2000.

Besides being one of France's most popular and enduring singers, he is also one of the best-known singers in the world. Charles Aznavour (pronounced in French as Sharl Aznavour) is known for his characteristic short figure and unique tenor voice; clear and ringing in its upper reaches, with gravelly and profound low notes. He has appeared in more than 60 movies, composed about 1,000 songs (including 150 at least in English, 100 in Italian, 70 in Spanish, and 50 in German), and has sold well over 100 million records.

In 1998, Charles Aznavour was named Entertainer of the Century by CNN and users of Time Online from around the globe. He was recognized as the century's outstanding performer, with nearly 18% of the total vote, edging out Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. He has sung for presidents, popes, and royalty, as well as at humanitarian events, and is the founder of the charitable organization Aznavour for Armenia along with his long-time friend and impresario Levon Sayan.

Aznavour started his global farewell tour in late 2006, which continues through this day. In 2009 he was appointed ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland, as well as Armenia's permanent delegate to the United Nations at Geneva.

Robert was born in Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, France. In his teens, he went to Paris to pursue a career in acting, starting with unpaid parts on stage in the city's various theatre workshops. From ages 12–20 he set type as a typographer, then studied mime in his early 20s. In 1948 he made his motion picture debut with one of the secondary roles in the film, Les Dieux du dimanche. Within a few years, Robert was writing scripts, directing, and producing.

Yves Robert's directorial efforts included several successful comedies for which he had written the screenplay. His 1962 film, La Guerre des boutons won France's Prix Jean Vigo. His 1972 film Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire won the Silver Bear at the 23rd Berlin International Film Festival in 1973. In 1976, Un éléphant ça trompe énormément, starring his wife, earned him international acclaim. Robert's 1973 devastating comedy Salut l'artiste is considered by many performers to be the ultimate film about the humiliations of the actor's life. In 1977, he directed another comedy, Nous irons tous au paradis, which was nominated for a César Award for Best Film.

In 1990, Robert directed two dramatic films, My Mother's Castle (Le château de ma mère) and My Father's Glory (La Gloire de mon Père). Based on autobiographical novels by Marcel Pagnol, they were jointly voted ""Best Film"" at the 1991 Seattle International Film Festival, and received rave reviews. Over his career, he directed more than twenty feature-length motion pictures, wrote an equal number of scripts, and acted in more than seventy-five films. Although his last major role was perhaps in 1980, A Bad Son by Claude Sautet, as the working-class father of a drug-dealer, he continued acting past 1997.

Robert played opposite Danièle Delorme in the 1951 play Colombe (Dove) by Jean Anouilh. They married in 1956, and jointly formed the film production company La Guéville in 1961. La Guéville also released several films by Monty Python and Terry Gilliam, which was very influential into establishing the comedy troupe to French audiences. He died in Paris on 10 May 2002 from a cerebral hemorrhage.

He directed 30 full-length feature films, including the highly successful That Man from Rio (L'Homme de Rio), The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique) and On Guard (Le Bossu). His works include historical, romantic epics such as Chouans! and King of Hearts (Le Roi de cœur), as well as comedies with a charismatic, breezy hero ready to embark upon any adventure which comes his way, so long as it means escaping everyday modern life: Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur), The Devil by the Tail (Le Diable par la queue), The African (L'Africain). He had links with the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, with whom he made six films, as well as with Jean-Pierre Cassel, Philippe Noiret and Jean Rochefort.

Philippe de Broca was born on 15 March 1933 in Paris, France. He was the son of a cinema set designer and the grandson of a well-known painter, Philippe de Broca. He studied at the Paris Photography and Cinematography School (école Vaugirard), graduating in 1953. He carried out his military service with the service cinématographique des armées (army film service) in Germany and then in Algeria, directing or acting as head cameraman on short films. Greatly affected by the war he witnessed, he vowed to show life in its best light in his future films “because laughter is the best defence against upsets in life”. After his discharge from the military, he set off on a journey taking in the length of Africa in Berliet trucks before returning to Paris.

He began working as an intern with Henri Decoin, before finding assistant positions with Claude Chabrol: Bitter Reunion (Le Beau Serge), The Cousins (Les Cousins), Web of Passion (À Double Tour), François Truffaut: The 400 Blows (Les 400 Coups) and Pierre Schoendoerffer: Ramuntcho. In 1959, Claude Chabrol produced de Broca's first film for him, The Love Game (Les jeux de l’amour) with Jean-Pierre Cassel. De Broca went on to work with Cassel again in The Joker (Le Farceur, 1960), Five Day Lover (L’Amant de cinq jours, 1961), and Male Companion (Un Monsieur de Compagnie, 1964).

De Broca's first commercial success came with Swords of Blood (Cartouche), filmed in 1962. This film also saw two more names become associated with de Broca: the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and the producer Alexandre Mnouchkine. International acclaim came with That Man from Rio (L'Homme de Rio) in 1964, Up to His Ears (Les tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine) in 1965, The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique) in 1973 and Incorrigible (L'Incorrigible) in 1975.

In 1966, he co-wrote, directed and produced King of Hearts (Le Roi de Cœur). This parody of the Great War, which some cinema-lovers consider his masterpiece, was a commercial and personal failure, to de Broca's dismay. Yet it eventually achieved genuine cult-film status during the mid 1970s when it was presented in repertory movie theaters as well as non-theatrical college and university film series across the United States, eventually running for five years at the now defunct film house, the Central Square Cinemas in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ...

Gélin was born in Angers, Maine-et-Loire, the son of Yvonne (née Le Méner) and Alfred Ernest Joseph Gélin.

When he was ten, his family moved to Saint-Malo where Daniel went to college until he was expelled for 'uncouthness'. His father then found him a job in a shop that sold cans of salted cod. It was seeing the shooting of Marc Allégret's film Entrée des artistes that triggered his desire to go to Paris to train to be an actor. He trained at the Cours Simon in Paris before entering the Conservatoire national d'art dramatique. There he met Louis Jouvet and embarked on a theatrical career. He made his first film appearance in 1940 in Miquette and for several years was an extra or played small roles in French films. He appeared with Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich in Martin Roumagnac (1946).

He won his first leading role in Rendez-vous de juillet (1949). From that time, he went on to appear in more than 150 films, including Max Ophüls' films La Ronde (1950) and Le Plaisir (1952), Jacques Becker's Édouard et Caroline (1951), Sacha Guitry's films Si Versailles m'était conté (Royal Affairs in Versailles) (1954) and Napoléon (1955), Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Jean Cocteau's Le Testament d'Orphée (1960), Le souffle au cœur (Murmur of the Heart) (1971), and La Nuit de Varennes (That Night in Varennes) (1982). He also wrote and directed one film, The Long Teeth, in 1952.

Gélin was a leading man in French cinema during the 1950s, but his career declined with the coming of the New Wave. He worked in theater for several years, but later found new success on screen as a character actor. He appeared extensively in French films and television productions from the 1970s until his death, often playing cynical characters or grumpy old men.

In 1946, Gélin married actress Danièle Delorme with whom he had a son, actor, director and producer Xavier Gélin. They divorced in 1954. While still married to Delorme, he had an affair with 17 year old model Marie Christine Schneider that produced a daughter, Maria Schneider. Due to his status as a married man, Gélin could not recognize Maria as his daughter. He visited the child several times but eventually severed his relationship with her mother. Maria Schneider and Daniel Gélin reconnected when she was sixteen and came to visit him. They remained in contact, although their relationship was irregular.

Gélin was married to model Sylvie Hirsch from 1954 until their divorce in 1968. This marriage produced three children, Pascal (who died aged one year), Fiona , and Manuel, the latter two also becoming actors. In 1973, he remarried to Lydie Zaks with whom he had a daughter, Laura.

Gélin died in Paris on 29 November 2002 of kidney failure.

He began his career appearing in music videos, made his film debut in Without You I'm Nothing and earned widespread recognition for his role as Cinqué in the Steven Spielberg film Amistad. As an actor, Hounsou has been nominated for two Academy Awards.

Hounsou became a naturalized American citizen in 2007. He was reluctant to renounce his Beninese citizenship and therefore opted to become a dual citizen of both Benin and the United States, effectively rendering him a Beninese-American.

Djimon Hounsou was born in Cotonou, Benin, in 1964, to lbertine and Pierre Hounsou. He immigrated to Lyon in France at the age of thirteen with his brother, Edmond. In 1987, he became a model and established a career in Paris. He moved to the U.S. in 1990. One year before obtaining his college degree, he dropped out of school.

In 1989, he appeared in a music video of Straight Up by Paula Abdul. Hounsou's film debut was in the 1990 Sandra Bernhard film Without You I’m Nothing, and he has had television roles on Beverly Hills, 90210 and ER and a guest starring role on Alias, but received a larger role in the science fiction film Stargate. His first on-screen appearance was in the 1990 Janet Jackson video “Love Will Never Do (Without You).” He also starred in a 2002 Gap commercial directed by Peter Lindbergh, dancing to a rendition of John Lee Hooker's ""Boom Boom"" by Arrested Development's Baba Oje.

He received wide critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award nomination for his role as Cinqué in the 1997 Steven Spielberg film Amistad. He gained further notice as Juba, in the 2000 film Gladiator. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for In America, in 2004, becoming the fourth African male to be nominated for an Oscar (along with Basil Rathbone, Cecil Kellaway and Omar Sharif). In 2006, he won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Blood Diamond; he received Broadcast Film Critics Association, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Academy Award nominations for this performance.

In 2007, Hounsou began dating model/CEO of Baby Phat, Kimora Lee Simmons. In 2008 Hounsou and Simmons visited Hounsou's family and while there, the two participated in a traditional commitment ceremony. On May 30, 2009, Simmons gave birth to their son, Kenzo Lee Hounsou, reportedly named because Kenzo means 3 (Kimora's third child).",1964-04-24,,938.0,Acting,"Cotonou, Dahomey [now Benin]",5.9501,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//tpvtxxvCx2Mb5DV632hmuYlHoiY.jpg

Mocky was born in Nice, France to Polish immigrant parents, Jeanne Zylinska and Adam Mokiejewski. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic.

Mocky appeared as an actor in the 1955 film Gli Sbandati and in many other movies, including some of those he also directed (Solo, L'albatros, L'Ombre d'une chance, Un Linceul n'a pas de poches). His 1987 film Le Miraculé was entered into the 37th Berlin International Film Festival.

He began as an actor in the cinema and theater. In particular, he played in Jean Dréville's Les Casse-pieds (1948), Jean Cocteau's Orphée (1950) and Bernard Borderie's The Mask of the Gorilla (1957). But it was especially in Italy that he became famous, thanks to his role in I vinti by Michelangelo Antonioni.

After working as an assistant with Luchino Visconti on Senso (1954) and Federico Fellini on La strada (1954), he wrote his first film, La Tête contre les murs (1959) and planned to direct it himself, but the producer preferred to entrust the task to Georges Franju. He went on to direct the following year with Les Dragueurs (1959). Since then, he has never stopped shooting.

As early as the 1960s, he was able to reach a wide audience with crazy comedies such as A Funny Parishioner (1963) and La Grande Lessive (1968). After May 1968, he turned to darker films with Solo (1969), in which he shows a group of young terrorists of the extreme left, then L'Albatros (1971) which shows the corruption of politicians.

In the 1980s, he returned to success with a film denouncing, a year before the drama of Heysel, the excesses of some football fans (À mort l'arbitre, 1984) and a comedy denouncing the hypocrisy around the pilgrimage to Lourdes (Le Miraculé, 1987). In the 1990s and 2000s, his films met with less success, but Mocky continued to shoot with much enthusiasm.

In the beginning, his films were dedicated to the uprising against the restrictions imposed by society. Later, he concentrated on farce, as in Bonsoir where the homeless Alex (Michel Serrault) pretends to be the lover of the lesbian Caroline (Claude Jade) in order to save her inheritance from her homophobic relatives.

Mocky's cinema, often satirical and pamphleteer, is generally inspired by the truth of society. He worked with few resources and filmed very quickly. He worked with Bourvil (A Funny Parishioner, The City of Unspeakable Fear, La Grande Lessive and The Stallion), Fernandel (The Exchange and Life), Michel Simon (The Red Ibis), Michel Serrault (twelve films including Le Miraculé), Francis Blanche (five films including The City of Unspeakable Fear), Jacqueline Maillan (five films), Jean Poiret (eight films) and with the stars Catherine Deneuve (Agent Trouble), Claude Jade (Bonsoir), Jane Birkin (Noir comme le souvenir), Jeanne Moreau (Le Miraculé) and Stéphane Audran (The Seasons of Pleasure).

In 2010, he received the Prix Henri-Langlois for his entire career and the 2013 Alphonse Allais Prize. The International Festival of Film Entrevues in Belfort in 2012 and the Cinémathèque française in 2014 dedicated full retrospectives to him.

He died on 8 August 2019.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his film Cousin Cousine (1975), which was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and which was later (1989) remade in a US version starring Ted Danson and titled Cousins.

Jean-Charles Tacchella studied in Marseilles and, just after the Liberation, left for Paris with the aim of becoming a film director. He joined L'écran Français when he was nineteen where he worked with Renoir, Becker and Grémillon. While with the magazine, he wrote about filmmakers, actors, films and met André Bazin, Nino Frank, Roger Leenhardt, Roger Thérond and Alexandre Astruc. He became friends with Erich Von Stroheim, Anna Magnani, Vittorio de Sica and created the monthly “Ciné Digest” with Henri Colpi. In 1948, Tacchella, along with Bazin, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, Astruc, Claude Mauriac, René Clément and Pierre Kast, established Objectif 49, an avant-garde film club whose president was Jean Cocteau. Objectif 49 became the birthplace of the New Wave.

Jean-Charles Tacchella has since directed eleven features, many of which have had successful international careers and been awarded prestigious prizes. They include Voyage to Grand Tartarie (1974), Cousin cousine (1975, nominated for the Oscars Césars, Silver Shell for Best Director at the 1976 San Sebastian International Film Festival), Le Pays bleu (1977), It's a Long Time I've Loved You (1979, Jury Prize at the Montreal Film Festival), Croque la vie (1981), Staircase C (1985, Prix de l'Académie française, Grand Prix at the Uppsala Film Festival), Travelling avant (1987, Best Male Newcomer for Thierry Frémont – Golden Tulip for Best Director at the Istanbul Film Festival), Gallant Ladies (Best Director, Digne Film Festival 1990), The Man of My Life (1992), Seven Sundays (1995).

Tacchella is described as being ""a smooth technician, Tacchella's camera work is fluid and precise"". And his movie Traveling avant (1987), roughly equivalent to the American film term ""Tracking Shot"", is described as ""a semi-autobiographical paean to his youth as a cinema fanatic and cine-club enthusiast in post-war Paris"".

Tacchella was President of the Cinémathèque Française from 2000–2003.

She became a princess in 1954 (until 1971).

Addams was born in Felixstowe, Suffolk, England, the daughter of Ethel Mary (née Hickie) and Captain James Ramage Addams, of the Royal Air Force. Her mother died when she was young, and she spent her early life in Calcutta, India.

Addams' face and physique attracted the attention of talent agents. In December 1950, she signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. Her film career began with a role in Night into Morning (1951), and her subsequent MGM films included Singin' in the Rain (1952), Plymouth Adventure (1952), Young Bess (1953) and the female lead opposite Peter Lawford in The Hour of 13 (1952). She played David Niven's daughter in The Moon Is Blue (1953), a film which helped loosen the system of censorship of Hollywood which had been in place since 1934. She also embarked on a USO tour the same year to help entertain troops in Korea. She worked steadily in films during the remainder of the 1950s, including a heavily publicised role as Richard Carlson's model girlfriend in the science fiction film Riders to the Stars (1954) and the female lead opposite actor-director-filmmaker legend Charlie Chaplin in his final comedy to star himself, A King in New York (1957). During the 1960s and 1970s, she appeared mainly in British TV shows and French films.

She was a semi-regular on the instructional series En France (1962) and the leading lady in several episodes of The Saint (1962–69), which starred Roger Moore as Simon Templar. Among her last film credits were two British horror films, The Vampire Lovers (1970) and The Vault of Horror (1973), and she was also a regular in the British sitcom Father, Dear Father (1971–1973). One of her last television roles was in the science fiction serial Star Maidens (1977). Addams retired in the early 1980s, dividing her remaining years between Europe and the United States.

She married Don Vittorio Emanuele Massimo, Prince of Roccasecca, in 1954; the wedding was the subject of a cover story in Life magazine. They separated four years later, though they did not formally divorce until 1971. Their son, Prince Stefano (b.1955), married Atalanta Foxwell, daughter of film producer Ivan Foxwell and Lady Edith (Lambart), granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Cavan.

In 1974 she married retired businessman Jimmy White.

His directorial debut, apart from a short film in 2002 'À l'abri des regards indiscrets', was in 2013 with the immigrant comedy La cage dorée. The film was inspired by his parents' biography, and Alves has a small guest role in the film as 'Miguel'. The movie has been a great success in France and Portugal, and has also been followed by a number of other countries, including Australia. In Portugal, it became in 2013 the most watched film of the year, with 755 000 viewings. In Germany he came as Portugal, mon amour in the cinemas. The film had 1.2m spectators in France and sold well internationally.

Then Alves played in 2014 in Yves Saint Laurent, a biopic about the life of the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent.

He is best known for his creation of fake parchments published in the 1967 book L'Or de Rennes by Gérard de Sède, as part of his involvement in the Priory of Sion hoax between 1962-1983.

Coming from a wealthy family in the Lorraine, de Chérisey decided to become an actor against his family's wishes. He enrolled in the René Simon drama school in 1946 where he started his actor's training, and his most notable film appearance was in Jeux interdits in 1952. He was known as a bon viveur, regularly enjoyed wine and frequented public libraries where his natural curiosity made him follow up anything that took his fancy.

Philippe de Chérisey was a follower of the surrealist movement. He claimed acquaintance with Eugene Ionesco and was like him a member of the College of Pataphysics, although - like his membership of Oulipo - there is no evidence that he was actively involved. His desire to subvert the norms of culture, or in other words, create an alternate reality that became more real than reality itself, was done within the context of the Priory of Sion and to promote the claim that Pierre Plantard was the direct descendant of Dagobert II. He considered himself a satirist from his days in French radio, and continued this persona within the theme of the Priory of Sion calling himself a prankster. The best known example of this is his esoteric novella Circuit (originally written in 1968, but not actually deposited within the Bibliothèque nationale de France until 1971).",1923-02-13,1985-07-17,40535.0,Acting,"Paris, France",0.271,https://i.ibb.co/x8tKqGZC/No-Image-500-750.png

Though his work ranged from high drama to absurdist farce, Anouilh is best known for his 1944 play Antigone, an adaptation of Sophocles' classical drama, that was seen as an attack on Marshal Pétain's Vichy government. His plays are less experimental than those of his contemporaries, having clearly organized plot and eloquent dialogue. One of France's most prolific writers after World War II, much of Anouilh's work deals with themes of maintaining integrity in a world of moral compromise.

Anouilh was born in Cérisole, a small village on the outskirts of Bordeaux, and had Basque ancestry. His father, François Anouilh, was a tailor, and Anouilh maintained that he inherited from him a pride in conscientious craftmanship. He may owe his artistic bent to his mother, Marie-Magdeleine, a violinist who supplemented the family's meager income by playing summer seasons in the casino orchestra in the nearby seaside resort of Arcachon. Marie-Magdeleine worked the night shifts in the music-hall orchestras and sometimes accompanied stage presentations, affording Anouilh ample opportunity to absorb the dramatic performances from backstage. He often attended rehearsals and solicited the resident authors to let him read scripts until bedtime. He first tried his hand at playwriting here, at the age of 12, though his earliest works do not survive.

In 1918 the family moved to Paris where the young Anouilh received his secondary education at the Lycée Chaptal. Jean-Louis Barrault, later a major French director, was a pupil there at the same time and recalls Anouilh as an intense, rather dandified figure who hardly noticed a boy some two years younger than himself. He earned acceptance into the law school at the Sorbonne but, unable to support himself financially, he left after just 18 months to seek work as a copywriter at the advertising agency Publicité Damour. He liked the work, and spoke more than once with wry approval of the lessons in the classical virtues of brevity and precision of language he learned while drafting advertising copy. ...

She won the César for best actress in 1988 for the role of Marcelle in Le Grand Chemin. She is the mother of two children; Jacob and Lilly.

She spent her childhood at Château Mauras, a family property in Bommes, in Gironde. After primary and secondary studies at the Sainte-Marie-des-Invalides school (today Paul Claudel-d'Hulst), at the Victor-Duruy high school, at the Gaudéchaux course, at the Jaillard course, at the Sévigné college, within the congregation of the canonesses of Saint-Augustin of the Congrégation Notre-Dame (at the Notre-Dame-des-Oiseaux convent in Megève, at the Saint-Pierre Fourier institute in Brunoy) and at the Institut Notre-Dame in Épernay, it pursued higher education at Paris-III University and then at Paris-X1 University. Anemone began her career at the café-théâtre with the Splendid troupe. She takes her pseudonym from the first film in which she shot, Anemone by Philippe Garrel. It was Coluche who offered her her first big role in the cinema in You will not have Alsace and Lorraine in 1977. In 1979, she created on stage the play written by the Splendid troupe, Le Père Noël est une junk . Her role as Thérèse earned her great success with the public, a success confirmed and amplified by the adaptation of the play to the cinema, directed by Jean-Marie Poiré.

In the 1980s, she was a very popular actress who starred in many comedies: ""Ma Femme S'Appelle Reviens"", ""Les Babas-Cool"", ""Pour Cent Briques, T'As Plus Rien""..., ""Le Quart d'Heure Américain"", and ""Le Mariage Du Siècle"", for which she wrote most of the screenplay. Michel Deville (Peril in the home, Aux petits bonheurs), then Jean-Loup Hubert offered her more serious roles from 1985. Successful counter-jobs, since she won the César for best actress for ""Le Grand Chemin"" in 1988.

In 1996, she played in the adaptation of Binet's comic strip, ""Les Bidochon"". In 2010, she returned to the cinema with the film ""Les Amours Secrètes"" by Franck Phelizon.

In December 2017, she announced that she would definitely end her career at the end of the year, and also took a very critical and disillusioned look in this same interview at what has become of the world in general, and that of show- bizz in particular. Militant like her brother for a return to a more ethical and ecological society, Anemone chooses to live in the countryside in the small village of Sainte-Soline (Deux-Sèvres), near Lezay.

He has often played romantic, womanizing roles, similar to those played by Marcello Mastroianni.

In 1987 he won a César Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his role in Mélo, and in 1994, a César Award for Best Actor for his role in Smoking/No Smoking.

Although his work has primarily been in French film and theater, Arditi is known in the Anglophone world as the French voice of Christopher Reeve. Arditi dubbed Christopher Reeve on the French-language version of the three first Superman movies by Richard Donner and Richard Lester (See the French Wikipedia article on Pierre Arditi for more information). Because of the added footage in the DVD Special Edition of Donner's Superman, the movie had to be re-dubbed with a different voice actor, much to the chagrin of the generation of moviegoers who had grown up with the original soundtrack and identified Superman's voice with Arditi's. He also provided the French voice for Reeve in the comedy/whodunit Deathtrap. Finally, he was the voice of the documentary serie Untamed Africa, written and produced by Frederic Lepage.

He was made Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d'honneur in 2002. He was made Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre national du Mérite on 7 April 1994, and promoted Officier (Officer) in 2005.

Frédéric Auburtin was born and grew up in Marseille, where he studied music (piano, drums) and literature before turning to the cinema in the early 80s. He made his debut as an assistant director in the film Rouge midi, directed by Robert Guédiguian.

In the 80s and 90s he worked as an assistant director in several movies and with several directors, including Maurice Pialat (Under the Sun of Satan), Luigi Comencini (La Bohème), Richard Heffron (La Révolution française), Bertrand Blier (Merci la vie), Jean-Jacques Annaud (The Lover), Claude Berri (Germinal and Lucie Aubrac), Jean-Paul Rappeneau (The Horseman on the Roof) and Randall Wallace (The Man in the Iron Mask).

In 1999, he debuted as a director, co-directing Un pont entre deux rives with Gérard Depardieu, for which he also composed the soundtrack. During the 2000s he keep directing mostly for television, but also directed movies, including San-Antonio (2004) and Envoyés très spéciaux (2009). In 2006, he co-directed (again with Depardieu) the segment ""Quartier Latin"", written and starred by Gena Rowlands with Ben Gazzara and Gérard Depardieu, in the highly acclaimed movie Paris, je t'aime.

In 2014, he became widely known for directing the infamous movie United Passions. The film recounts the origins of the world-governing body of association football, Fédération Internationale de Football Association, and was ninety-percent funded by them. Released in North America at the peak of the scandals of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, the film grossed very badly in the box-office (a mere $918 in its opening weekend) and received overwhelming dislike from critics around the world. It's now considered one of the worst movies ever made and all the actors and Auburtin himself considered the film a ""disaster"".

During his career, he wrote 80 films for directors such as René Clément, Bertrand Tavernier, Marcel Carné, Jean Delannoy and Claude Autant-Lara. He is often associated with the screenwriter Pierre Bost, with whom he had a fertile partnership from 1940 to 1975.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Jean Aurenche was friends with some members of the surrealist groups. His sister Marie-Berthe was the wife of Max Ernst and Max Ernst soon became friend with Jean Aurenche. Later, he even appeared in some film commercials directed by Jean Aurenche (for the ""Nicolas"" Wine, the ""Barbes"" stores and so on...). Jean Aurenche was also a close friend of Jean Cocteau who helped him publish several of his short stories in the famous ""NRF"".

In 1933, Jean Aurenche co-directed two short documentaries with Pierre Charbonnier: Pirates du Rhône and Bracos de Sologne. He later co-wrote the short film Monsieur Cordon with director Pierre Prévert. He soon turned to screenwriting, writing or co-writing several films like L'affaire du Courrier de Lyon (1936) by Maurice Lehmann and Claude Autant-Lara, L'affaire Lafarge or, more famously, Hôtel du Nord that he co-wrote with Marcel Carné and Henri Jeanson.

In 1942, starting with Douce (directed by Autant-Lara), Aurenche formed a longstanding partnership with Pierre Bost. Their method of writing together initially worked as such: Jean Aurenche wrote the treatment of the screenplay (sometimes based on a novel) and Pierre Bost then expanded this outline and wrote the dialogue. But soon, both of them wrote all the script together without any clear division of the writing. Together, Aurenche & Bost wrote several great successes of this time period, often associated with director Claude Autant-Lara : le Diable au corps (1945), l'Auberge rouge (1951), le Rouge et le Noir (1954), la Traversée de Paris (1956). Meanwhile, Aurenche & Bost started a fertile collaboration with Jean Delannoy, writing for him La Symphonie Pastorale (1947) which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival of 1947. During this time, they also worked with René Clément (Au-delà des grilles, Jeux interdits and Gervaise). The film Jeux Interdits won the Academy Award on the Best Foreign Film in 1952 and soon became a classic. All these critic and commercial triumph contributed to make of Aurenche one of the most revered screenwriters of his time. ...

Marcel André Aymé was born in Joigny, in the Burgundy region of France, the youngest of six children. His father, Joseph, was a blacksmith, and his mother, Emma Monamy, died when he was two years old, after the family had moved to Tours. Marcel was sent to live with his maternal grandparents in the village of Villers-Robert, a place where he would spend the next eight years, and which would serve as the model for the fictitious village of Claquebue in what is perhaps the most well-known of his novels, La Jument verte. In 1906 Marcel entered the local primary school. Because his grandfather was a staunch anti-clerical republican, he was looked down upon by his classmates, many of whose parents held more traditional views. Accordingly, Marcel was not baptized before reaching the age of eight, nearly two years after the death of his grandfather in 1908. Orphaned once more when his grandmother died two years later, he briefly lived with other family members before moving to Dole, a small town of the Franche-Comte region, to stay with an aunt and attend the Collège de l'Arc, where he demonstrated more ability in mathematics than in literature. His years at school there were an unpleasant experience he would never look back on fondly.

Despite ongoing issues with his health that had begun when he was a child, Aymé was able to perform his military service, which began in 1919, as part of an artillery unit in the occupied Rhineland. In 1923 he moved to Paris where he worked unsuccessfully at a bank, an insurance company, and as a journalist. Though he failed in his career as a reporter, his stint at the newspaper allowed him to discover his love of writing.

His first published novel was Brûlebois (1926), and in 1929 his La Table aux crevés won the Prix Renaudot. After the great success of his novel La Jument verte (1933), translated into English as The Green Mare, he concentrated mostly on writing and published children's stories, novels, and collections of stories. In 1935 he also started writing movie scripts. In theater, Marcel Aymé found success with his plays Lucienne et le boucher, Clérambard (1949), a farce, and Tête des autres (1952), which criticized the death penalty.

He died in 1967 and was buried in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.

One of Aymé's most famous short stories is Le passe-muraille or ""The Walker-Through-Walls"". At the age of 42, Dutilleul suddenly discovers that he has ""the remarkable gift of being able to pass through walls with perfect ease"". What begins as a novelty that gives him pleasure ends up pushing Dutilleul toward ever more sinister pursuits.

Visitors to Paris can see a monument in his honor at Place Marcel-Aymé, in the Montmartre Quarter. The statue is based upon his short story ""Le passe-muraille"" (""The Walker through Walls"").

Baffie (often only called by his last name) is famous for his funny hidden cameras, sense of repartee, biting humour as well as musical and animal culture.

His 2005 play TOC TOC (which alludes to OCD) was translated into Spanish by Julián Quintanilla in 2010 and has been a box office hit in Spain, where it has been on stage for eight seasons and more than 1500 shows, in Argentina where it ran for nine years and was viewed by more than 1.7 million people, and in Mexico where more than 1000 shows were performed.

Son of a battered wife, Laurent Baffie gave up school in Year 9 (""classe de 4ème""), to start an accountant training before moving to theatre. He started earning money as an extra in the variety shows of Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier.

From 1985, he wrote skits, notably for Jean-Marie Bigard in the show La Classe on France 3. Since then, he has always participated in the writing the shows of his friend.

In 1990, he created and presented the show Vas-y, fais-nous rire on Fun Radio. He also took part of Philippe Bouvard's show, Les Grosses Têtes. In 1993, he presented a show called Ze Baffie Show on Skyrock, with the help of one of his friends back then, Jarlot. In 1999, he created C'est quoi ce bordel on Europe 2.

From 9 September 2007 until 3 July 2011, he again worked as a radio presenter, this time on Europe 1. The show, which was broadcast every Sunday between 11 and noon, reused some concepts from C'est quoi ce bordel?. Its title changed every week during the first years (Coloscopie, Demain, c'est mardi, C'était mieux dimanche dernier, Papy fait de la résistance, Vous êtes bien sur RTL, Julie, droguée, prostituée et fière de l'être, Baffie est un sale con, Taisez-vous Elkabbach, Ma vieille chatte perd ses poils, etc.) before changing to its final name C'est quoi ce bordel. He was always with Julie from Europe 1. In his Sunday show, he used samples, on which Julie recorded sentences, using off the wall humour, as well as the famous sentence from Édouard Balladur ""je vous demande de vous arrêter"" (I ask you to stop). He also uses jingle samples of Europe 1 and other radios and adverts, which he uses for phone pranks. In June 2011, he announced he had been laid off, the radio station imputing it to economic reasons. His last show was broadcast on 3 July 2011. He was replaced by Marion Ruggieri with her show called Il n'y en a que pour elle.

Baffie came back on the radio on 25 September 2011 on Rire et Chansons where he restarted his show C'est quoi ce bordel? which had already been on Europe 2, then Europe 1. On 14 January 2013, he announced he had been laid off from Rire et Chansons. In 2013, he joined Philippe Bouvard's team in the show Grosses Têtes. He stayed in this show even after Laurent Ruquier arrived in 2014.

He is particularly known for his photographs of celebrities and other public figures and for his friendships with members of high society. In a prominent legal case, in 2016 he was convicted of 'abuse of weakness' of the elderly billionaire Liliane Bettencourt.

Banier was born in Paris, France. He grew up in a middle-class family in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. He has claimed he had been ""completely incomprehensible to [his] parents"".

Despite his modest background, from an early age he was a precocious and hyperactive talent, who was able to develop friendships with some of Paris' wealthiest arts patrons and artists. At the age of 16, he met Salvador Dalí, who would send his car to bring Banier to his suite at the Hotel Meurice to discuss art. At the age of 19, he befriended the wealthy heiress and patron of the arts Marie-Laure de Noailles who was then 64.

Banier published his first novel, Les Résidences secondaires ou la Vie distraite (Second Homes or Distracted Life), at the age of 22. Around the same time, a well-known Parisian designer and antique dealer Madeleine Castaing collected some of his photographs.

Over the years, Banier befriended many well-known public figures and celebrities, including Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin, Françoise Sagan, Samuel Beckett, Vladimir Horowitz, Louis Aragon, François Mitterrand, Kate Moss, Mick Jagger and Princess Caroline of Monaco. He is a friend of Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Vanessa Paradis, whom he met at his home in the south of France. Banier is godfather to their daughter, Lily-Rose. As of 2008 he shared his house with actor Pascal Greggory and his nephew Martin d’Orgeval.

In 1987, Banier was commissioned to photograph Liliane Bettencourt and Federico Fellini for the French magazine Egoiste. Bettencourt was one of the principal shareholders of L'Oréal and one of the wealthiest persons in the world with an estimated fortune of US$40.1 billion. Over the ensuing years, Banier and Bettencourt became friends and she became his chief benefactor, bestowing gifts upon him estimated to be worth as much as €1.3 billion. These gifts included a life insurance policy worth €253 million in 2003, another life insurance policy worth €262 million in 2006, 11 works of art in 2001 valued at €20 million, including paintings by Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian, Delaunay and Léger and a photograph by surrealist Man Ray and cash. The life insurance policies were allegedly signed over to Banier after Bettencourt was recovering from two hospital stays in 2003 and 2006. ...

In film, he held several leading roles but is especially distinguished in auxiliary roles depicting more limited characters. He is especially remembered for his first-class performance in Army of Shadows by Jean-Pierre Melville in 1969. Appearing in a number of soaps and TV shows of the late 1960s to early 1980s, Barbier gained a certain notoriety thanks to the character of Joseph Durtol, bounded and proud hero of The Man of Picardy, the legendary French television series.

He first experienced success in 1951 with Le Don d'Adèle, which he wrote along with Jean-Pierre Gredy. The play was performed over a thousand times.

In the 1980s, Barillet appeared in television shows, including Malesherbes, avocat du roi, and Condorcet.

In the 1990s, he wrote biographies, such as Les Seigneurs du rire, about Robert de Flers, Gaston Arman de Caillavet, and Francis de Croisset.

He was born in Nyons, a town in the Drôme department in southeastern France. He is best known as a science fiction author, whose work often involved the fall of civilisation due to technocratic hubris and the madness of war, but who also favoured themes emphasising the durability of love.

René Barjavel wrote several novels with these themes, such as Ravage (translated as Ashes, ashes), Le Grand Secret, La Nuit des temps (translated as The Ice People), and Une rose au paradis. His writing is poetic, dreamy and sometimes philosophical. Some of his works have their roots in an empirical and poetic questioning of the existence of God (notably La Faim du tigre). He was also interested in the environmental heritage which we leave to future generations. Whilst his works are rarely taught in French schools, his books are very popular in France.

Barjavel wrote Le Voyageur imprudent (1943), the first novel to present the famous Grandfather paradox of time travel: if one goes backwards in time and kills one of their ancestors before he had children, the traveller cannot exist and therefore cannot kill the ancestor.

Barjavel died in 1985 and was buried with his ancestors in Tarendol (commune) cemetery, opposite Mount Ventoux in Provence. He used these place names in his books; Mount Ventoux appears as the site of the space base in Colomb de la lune, for example, and Tarendol is the name of the hero in the eponymous novel.

She is best known for her performance in Cousin Cousine (1975) for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 2010, she released her autobiography, titled This Long Way To Get To You.

Marie-Christine Barrault was born in Paris, France, the daughter of Martha (née Valmier) and Max-Henri Barrault. Her parents later divorced. Barrault's father, who worked in the theatre, died while she was a teenager. With no support, her mother was unable to care for her and her brother, Alain. Barrault was raised by her grandmother, Felicite. She was mentored in acting by her aunt and uncle, French performers Jean-Louis Barrault and Madeleine Renaud. They initially did not support her dreams of becoming an actress. She performed in plays in secondary school and then enrolled in an acting conservatory.

Barrault got her start on television in L'oeuvre (1967). She made her feature film debut in Éric Rohmer's My Night at Maud's (1969). In 1970 Barrault was featured along with Pierre Richard in the comedy film Le Distrait. In 1975 Barrault starred in Cousin Cousine, for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She worked with Rohmer once again in 1978, in the role of Guinevere in Perceval le Gallois and she also has a cameo in his Chloe in the Afternoon.

Barrault is not fluent in English and therefore has generally turned down offers to appear in English-language films. However, in 1980 she accepted an offer from Woody Allen to appear in his film Stardust Memories. In 1988 she was nominated for a Genie Award for her performance in No Blame. In 1991 she portrayed Marie Curie in a television mini-series. In her later career, she has preferred acting on the stage in France. In 2015, she came to Los Angeles on tour to perform in the play Les Yeux Ouverts, in which she portrays French author Marguerite Yourcenar.

Barrault's first husband was producer Daniel Toscan du Plantier, whom she married in 1965. With him, she had two children, David and Ariane. Barrault was married to director Roger Vadim from 1990 until his death from cancer in 2000. She herself is a breast cancer survivor.

His work engaged in the analysis of a variety of sign systems, mainly derived from Western popular culture. His ideas explored a diverse range of fields and influenced the development of many schools of theory, including structuralism, anthropology, literary theory, and post-structuralism.

Barthes is perhaps best known for his 1957 essay collection Mythologies, which contained reflections on popular culture, and 1967 essay ""The Death of the Author,"" which critiqued traditional approaches in literary criticism. During his academic career he was primarily associated with the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) and the Collège de France.

Roland Barthes was born on 12 November 1915 in the town of Cherbourg in Normandy. His father, naval officer Louis Barthes, was killed in a battle during World War I in the North Sea before Barthes's first birthday. His mother, Henriette Barthes, and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of Urt and the city of Bayonne. In 1924, Barthes' family moved to Paris, though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life.

Barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the Sorbonne, where he earned a licence in classical literature. He was plagued by ill health throughout this period, suffering from tuberculosis, which often had to be treated in the isolation of sanatoria. His repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career, affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations. They also exempted him from military service during World War II.

His life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a licence in grammar and philology, publishing his first papers, taking part in a medical study, and continuing to struggle with his health. He received a diplôme d'études supérieures (roughly equivalent to an MA by thesis) from the University of Paris in 1941 for his work in Greek tragedy.

In 1948, he returned to purely academic work, gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in France, Romania, and Egypt. During this time, he contributed to the leftist Parisian paper Combat, out of which grew his first full-length work, Writing Degree Zero (1953).

In 1952, Barthes settled at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, where he studied lexicology and sociology. During his seven-year period there, he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine Les Lettres Nouvelles, in which he dismantled myths of popular culture (gathered in the Mythologies collection that was published in 1957). Consisting of fifty-four short essays, mostly written between 1954 and 1956, Mythologies were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling. Knowing little English, Barthes taught at Middlebury College in 1957 and befriended the future English translator of much of his work, Richard Howard, that summer in New York City. ...

Credited with reviving the French chanson in ""a time of French musical turmoil"", he is often regarded in his home country as the most important French rock musician after Serge Gainsbourg. He rose to prominence in the early 1980s with hit songs such as ""Gaby oh Gaby"" and ""Vertige de l'amour"", and later had a string of hit records from the 1990s onward, such as ""Osez Joséphine"", ""Ma petite entreprise"" and ""La nuit je mens"". He has had an influence on many later French artists, and is the most awarded artist in the Victoires de la Musique history with 12 victories obtained throughout his career.

Bashung's Play blessures (1982), Osez Joséphine (1991), and Fantaisie militaire (1998) have made multiple French lists of the greatest albums. L'Imprudence (2002) and Bleu pétrole (2008), the last two studio albums released during his lifetime, also garnered acclaim. Bashung died at 61 after a two-year fight with lung cancer.

Alain Baschung (he later dropped the ""c"" from his surname) was the son of a Breton mother working in a rubber factory and an Algerian father, whom he never knew. His mother remarried, and at the age of one, Bashung was sent to Wingersheim, near Strasbourg to live with his stepfather's parents. He spent his childhood in the countryside, in a rather conservative environment, alongside a grandmother who did not speak French. He discovered music during his childhood, notably Kurt Weill's Mahagonny, and began to practice with a Rosebud harmonica offered to him when he was five. He also practiced basketball and cycling and sang in the church choir of Wingersheim.

He came back to Paris in 1959, where he discovered the great chanson artists, and then rock artists such as Gene Vincent, Buddy Holly (whom he admired deeply), and Elvis Presley. While studying (before dropping out after he was awarded a BTS in accountancy from the École nationale de commerce in 1965), he formed a band called Les Dunces playing folk music and rockabilly.

He later formed a band with musicians met in Royan, and then began to tour in restaurants, hotels and U.S. military bases. He began his career with his first EP, ""Pourquoi rêvez-vous des États-Unis?"" in 1966, which he wrote and composed. At the same time, he joined the RCA label to become a music arranger. He wrote songs for French artists. In June 1967, at the Palais des Sports of Paris, he was the opening act (alongside Noël Deschamps and Ronnie Bird) of artists such as the Pretty Things, the Troggs or Cream.

In 1968, he released his first single, ""Les Romantiques"", which was largely ignored by the public and unsuccessful. Around that time, he dropped the ""c"" from his name and spent some time at the house of fellow singer Christophe.

From 1972 to 1974, he composed some of the music and cowrote three albums and three singles (including ""Marilou"") for French rock singer Dick Rivers. In 1973, he played Robespierre in the musical La Révolution française by Claude-Michel Schönberg. ...

These include L'enfant qui veut vider la mer (1968), Julos chante pour vous (1969), Chandeleur 75 (1975), Les communiqués colombophiles (1976), Julos au Théâtre de la ville (1977), La p'tite gayole (1981), Chansons d'amour (2002), a double album with Barbara Alcantara given to the farm of Wahenge, site of the post-industrial pagodas near the village where he lived, and two CDs where he sings poems he set to music. These albums range from song collages, recited poems, humorous monologues, to ""catch-up sounds and voice clips"". Each album is thus an atmosphere more than a concept, which reflects a state of mind mixing revolt (lettre à Kissinger, Bosnia and Herzegovina), tenderness (Y Vaut Meyeu S'bêtchi), humor (Pompes funèbres) and everyday life, as his neighbor's voice in the ""communiqués colombophiles"" (pigeon releases). He refused stardom, had his own publishing house, records and books (Publishing Louise-Hélène France). He continued to live in his village of Tourinnes-la-Grosse in Wallonia and talked by himself on the forum of his website.

The murder of his wife Loulou (Louise-Hélène France) at Candlemas in 1975, changed his style to a more humanist one. That night he wrote an open letter analyzing the guilt of the society that put the weapon in the hands of assassins, along with a call to ""reforest the human soul"" with ""love, friendship and persuasion"". After this tragedy, he traveled, particularly in Quebec and he strengthened his ties with French speakers' singers culture. At the death of King Baudouin, he was chosen as a symbol of the Belgian people to sing a tribute to the late king. He was knighted in July 2002 by King Albert II. He also signed the Manifesto for Walloon culture in 1983.

He put poems into songs, from Belgian authors (especially Max Elskamp) or non-Belgian, which gave birth to the songs ""Je ne songeais pas à Rose"" (Victor Hugo), ""Je fais souvent ce rêve étrange"" (Paul Verlaine).

He played the ""father Jacques"" in The Mystery of the Yellow Room and Le Parfum de la dame en noir.

In 2012, he played the role of father of Prudence in Associés contre le crime Pascal Thomas, Catherine Frot and Dussollier.

Henry Bean (born 1945, Philadelphia, United States) is an American screenwriter, film director, producer, novelist, and actor.

Most famous as a screenwriter, Bean wrote the screenplays for Internal Affairs, Deep Cover, Venus Rising, The Believer (which was awarded the dramatic Grand Jury Prize at the 2001 Sundance Festival), Basic Instinct 2 and Noise.

Bean acted in The Believer, and was a producer on Deep Cover and Noise. He was the director for The Believer and Noise.

Bean is also the inspiration for the main protagonist of Noise. He was so tired of constant noise around him and his home in New York that he decided to take the law into his own hands. If a car alarm was going off and the owner of the vehicle didn't rectify the situation, Bean would break into the car to disable the offending car alarm. Bean was eventually arrested and jailed. He admits to doing it a few more times since

Becker first worked in the 1930s as an assistant to director Jean Renoir during what is considered the latter's peak period, including such works as Partie de campagne (1936) and La Grande Illusion (1937). In the early part of World War II, Becker was held in a German prisoner-of-war camp for a year. During the Nazi occupation of France, he became a film director in his own right and he also joined the Comité de libération du cinéma français. He would go on to direct the period romance Casque d'or (1952), the influential gangster film Touchez pas au grisbi (1954), and the prison escape drama Le Trou (1959). While he remains lesser-known internationally than peers such as Marcel Carné and Renoir, Becker is nonetheless regarded as a major French filmmaker, with Casque d'or held in high esteem among film critics.

Becker died at the age of 53 in 1960 and was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

Born in Beirut to an Armenian father and a Greek mother, Berbérian spent his youth in Lebanon before finishing his studies in France. He was the brother of cartoonist Charles Berberian. He began his career in the audiovisual field, working as an editor at Canal+.

His first feature film was the comedy La Cité de la peur, which was hit in France. Based on a script by Les Nuls, the film describes a series of murders in Cannes. Berbérian returned in 1998 with Paparazzi, starring Vincent Lindon and Patrick Timsit. The film follows the life of a night watchman (Timsit) who is fired after being photographed at a soccer game, instead of being at his job. He then meets Michel (Lindon), who teaches him how to be a paparazzo.

In 2000, Berbérian directed Six-Pack, a thriller with Richard Anconina who stalks a serial-killer to the four corners of Paris. Returning in 2002 with the comedy Le Boulet, starring Gérard Lanvin and Benoît Poelvoorde, a prison guard (Poelvoorde) has to team up with a convict (Lanvin) to retrieve a lotto ticket from the latter.

Then in 2004, Berbérian paired Christian Clavier and Jean Reno in the comedy, The Corsican File, based on a comic book of the same name by René Pétillon, in which a detective is responsible for locating a man living in Corsica who is owed an inheritance. In 2007, he reunited Gérard Jugnot and Jean-Paul Rouve in L'Île aux trésors.

Berbérian died in Paris, France, on 22 August 2017, at the age of 64.

He was a very popular figure on stage, radio and in films, during the 1950s and 1960s. His two daughters, Barbara & Dominique, are artists with their studios in Eze.

Blanche was born in an artistic family, mainly of stage actors—including his father Louis Blanche and his uncle, Emmanuel Blanche, who was a painter—. He completed his secondary schooling at fourteen, the youngest in France to do so at the time.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Blanche was part of Robert Dhéry's theatrical company Les Branquignols, with whom he played in the film Ah! Les belles bacchantes, starring Robert Dhéry, Colette Brosset (Dhéry's then-wife), and Louis de Funès; directed by Jean Loubignac in 1954.

Blanche teamed up with Pierre Dac to form a comic duo best remembered for Le Sâr Rabindranath Duval, a sketch about a phony and nonsensical Indian clairvoyant and guru (1957). They also created a popular and equally nonsensical radiophonic series, loosely based on a highly improbable espionage and conspiration plot, Malheur aux barbus, which was broadcast on Paris Inter in 213 episodes from 1951 to 1952. The same plot and characters were revived on Europe 1 in a series called Signé Furax, enjoying no less than 1,034 daily episodes between 1956 and 1960. Both broadcasts were phenomenal audience successes in the pre-television era. Blanche was also renowned for broadcasting phone pranks, in which he entertained listeners by making the most improbable situations sound plausible.

He wrote poems, and the lyrics of 673 songs. On stage, he acted in Tartuffe and Néron and, in 1955, Chevalier du Ciel, an operetta by Luis Mariano at the Gaîté-Lyrique theatre.

Blanche also enjoyed a successful cinematographic career, both as an actor and scriptwriter. He appeared as a hard-headed German colonel (""Obersturmführer Schulz"") opposite Brigitte Bardot in Babette s'en va-t-en guerre (1959). He was one of the favourite actors of French filmmaker Georges Lautner, and played Maître Folace (a shady solicitor counselling a colourful gangster mob) in Les Tontons flingueurs (1963). Blanche also appeared in Boris Vassilief's Les Barbouzes (1964).

He delighted in parodying classical music, adapting famous works such as Schubert's ""Die Forelle"" (The Trout) into a crazy and slightly risqué piece about a 16-year-old romantic girl obsessed with Schubert's song to the point of giving birth to a live trout while performing it on her piano. Similarly, he turned Beethoven's 5th Symphony into a lengthy and quite repetitive musical glorification of the clothes peg and its fictitious inventor, Jérémie-Victor Opdebec.

Blanche died at the age of 52, from a heart attack with a background of untreated Type 1 diabetes. He is buried in Èze cemetery.

He belonged to the literary group called the Hussards. He was also a sports columnist in L'Équipe. Blondin also wrote under the name Tenorio.

Blondin was the son of a poet, Germaine Blondin, whose name he took, and of a printer's proof-reader. He earned a degree in philosophy the Sorbonne after studying at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris and the Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen. He became very close to Roland Laudenbach during World War II. He was sent to Germany in 1942 for compulsory war work during the German occupation of World War II. The experience inspired his first novel, L'Europe buissonnière, which appeared in 1949. It won the Prix des Deux Magots, named after a literary café in Paris, and brought him the friendship of authors such as Marcel Aymé and Roger Nimier and the philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre. In 1953, the young critic Bernard Frank dubbed the novelists Roger Nimier, Jacques Laurent, and Blondin as ""les Hussards,"" a title which stuck. The Hussars were characterized by their shared right-wing literary heritage, youthful irreverence towards leftist intellectuals, and a commitment to ""art for art's sake."" Blondin's right-wing leanings did not, however, prevent a friendship with the socialist François Mitterrand, for whom he later came to vote.

His next novels, Les Enfants du bon Dieu and L'Humeur vagabonde confirmed a distinctive style which critics placed between Stendhal and Jules Renard. Turns of phrase such as ""After the second world war, the trains started moving again. I profited from that by leaving my wife and children"" and ""I have stayed very thin, and so has my body of work,"" are exemplary of Blondin's affinity for wordplay and humor. The themes of friendship, bohemianism, and the historical shock of World War II also held a prominent place in his fiction. After publishing the well-received novel Un Singe en hiver, Blondin remained an active journalist, but the death of his best friend Roger Nimier prompted him to largely abandon writing fiction for over a decade. Nonetheless, he won the 1977 Prix Goncourt de la Nouvelle for the short story collection Quat'saisons.

Blondin wrote press columns supporting the right in politics. He was a monarchist and wrote for monarchist publications such as Aspects de la France, La Nation Française and Rivarol. Although he was associated with Action Française intellectuals and the Maurrassian right during the beginning of his career, he distanced himself from politics later in his life. He also wrote sports features for L'Équipe, for which he covered 27 editions of the Tour de France and seven Olympic Games. The Tour de France winner, Bernard Hinault, said: ""He never interviews anybody but just records his impressions of what he's seen and what he feels. Sometimes René Fallet was with him. They both love the Tour and, in simple language, they turn it into a modern epic, a troubador's song, a crusade, as they describe its beauty. The most banal event becomes significant to Blondin; he has only to see it and write about it. He raised the status of the Tour by giving it his own cachet; it became a myth to be renewed every year. No matter how predictable the race, he could maintain the interest in it."" ...

In the 1920s, while working for the French customs service, Bonifas took classes in acting at the Conservatoire de Paris in his spare time. He left with the first prize for comedy, which allowed him to join the Odéon Theatre in 1933, then the Comédie-Française in 1938.

He made his first film appearance in 1935 in a version of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, directed by Pierre Chenal.

During World War II he served as a lieutenant in the artillery, was badly wounded, and evacuated from Dunkirk with his unit. In London he joined the Free French, and worked for Radio Londres broadcasting to occupied France.

In 1942 he appeared in the film The Foreman Went to France.

In 1943 he formed ""The Molière Players"", who staged a repertoire of mainly Molière works in London theatres, as well as in regional towns and at French army barracks. He came to the Comedy Theatre, London with Théâtre Molierè in 1943 and 1944, performing in L'Anglais Tel Qu'on Le Parle, Le Malade Imaginaire, Gringoire, Le Misanthrope et L'Auvergnat, Les Femmes Savantes, Le Paquebot Tenacity, La Testament Du Pere Leleu and L'Extra. His Company included Andre Frere, Georges Rex, Suzette Marquis, Elma Soiron and Paul Clarus.

In 1944 ""The Molière Players"" appeared in the short film Aventure malgache directed by Alfred Hitchcock. This was written by, and based on the experiences of, Jules Francois Clermont, an actor in Bonifas' troupe working under the name of Paul Clarus, who had operated an illegal radio station Madagascar Libre in Madagascar while the island was under Vichy control.

Bonifas then appeared in a number of other British films, including Two Fathers with Bernard Miles, directed by Anthony Asquith, and had minor roles in the musicals Heaven Is Round the Corner and Champagne Charlie, the action adventure film The Man from Morocco, the comedy-drama Johnny Frenchman and the horror film Dead of Night.

Bonifas returned to France in 1946 and resumed his career in theatre, specializing in comedy, but also taking dramatic roles.

His later film career included appearances in Trapeze (1956), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1956), Fanny (1961), Charade (1963), Greed in the Sun (1964), The Train (1964), Is Paris Burning? (1966), Triple Cross (1966), and The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974).

He won the 1977 Prix Renaudot for Les Combattants du petit bonheur. Boudard's 1995 novel Dying childhood was awarded and recognised by the French Academy with a Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française.

Boudard was born in Paris, an illegitimate child. He was brought up first by an adoptive family in the Loiret region of the center of France, then by his grand mother in the south of Paris. Boudard had a late career. As a teenager he was living in a country occupied by the German Army. He was wounded fighting for the French and he was awarded a military medal. His early adult life was spent in casual work, periods in jail and in a sanatorium recovering from tuberculosis. He experimented with writing, but it was not until he was 33 that he decided to be a full-time writer. He credits the writer Albert Paraz with inspiring this move.

His novels are characterised by the colloquial terms and slang that Boudard used to describe life in the 1940s. His works are autobiographical and he uses his periods in a sanatorium and in jail as a basis for his stories. His 1963 novel The Cherry and his 1972 story The Hospital are examples, as is his 1992 novel The amazing Mr Joseph which tells the story of a French spy who becomes a millionaire dealing on the black market during World War II (based on the real career of Joseph Joanovici).

Many of Boudard novels were adapted for French films and television.

Boudard had a wife and two sons. He died in Nice on 14 January 2000.

He appeared in more than 100 films from 1947 to 2020. He won the Best Actor European Film Award for Toto the Hero in 1991 and two Best Actor Césars for How I Killed My Father (2001) and The Last Mitterrand (2005). He also received the Molière Award for Best Actor for Les côtelettes in 1998, then again for Exit the King in 2005. In 2014, he was awarded the Honorary Molière for the sum of his career. He received the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 2018.

Michel François Pierre Bouquet was born on 6 November 1925 in Paris. When he was seven years old, he was sent to a boarding school where he stayed until the age of 14. He aspired to become a doctor but had to quit school at the age of 15 after his father had been taken prisoner during World War II. Bouquet worked as a baker's apprentice, then a bank clerk, to provide for the family. After a short stay in Lyon, he returned with his mother to Paris. Marie Bouquet was passionate about theater, and that helped the young Bouquet to find his vocation. He took acting classes under the tutelage of Maurice Escande, a member of the Comédie Française, and made his stage debut in the play La première étape in 1944. Then he studied at the Conservatory of Dramatic Arts in Paris where he met Gérard Philippe.

In the mid-1940s Michel Bouquet began working with the playwright Jean Anouilh and director André Barsacq, who staged plays at the Théâtre de l'Atelier in Montmartre. In 1946, Anouilh gave Bouquet a part in Roméo and Jeannette, followed by The Rendez-vous of Senlis and The Invitation to the Castle in 1947. In the 1950s, the actor met another stage director, Jean Vilar, with whom he would frequently collaborate. Bouquet played many roles from the classical repertoire at the Festival d'Avignon, created by Vilar in 1947 (Henry IV in 1950, The Tragedy of King Richard II in 1953, and The Miser in 1962). Bouquet regularly worked with Anouilh until the early 1970s, then helped popularize in France the works of the British author Harold Pinter: The Collection in 1965, The Birthday Party in 1967 and No Man's Land in 1979.

At the same time, at the end of the 1970s, Michel Bouquet was appointed professor at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Arts and taught there until 1990. In the 1980s-1990s, he returned to the Théâtre de l'Atelier where he once began his career. In 1994, he played in Exit the King by Eugène Ionesco, the role he would perform many times until 2014. In 1998 he received the Molière Award for Best Actor for Bertrand Blier's Les côtelettes, then again for Exit the King in 2005. In 2014, he was awarded the Honorary Molière for the sum of his career. A year later, the actor received accolades for his performance in Taking Sides by the British playwright Ronald Harwood. Bouquet announced his retirement from stage in 2019. ...

He achieved considerable success with his first attempt at screenwriting, Forbidden Games (1952). Initially, he found no studio interested in his work, so he redesigned the screenplay as a novel and published it in 1947 under the title The Secret Game. Although the novel achieved little or no success in its native country, it became a huge commercial success in America. All of a sudden, Boyer's novel was a hot property, so director René Clément, in conjunction with two writers Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost, helped turn it into a screenplay. While Boyer receives story credit for the film, little is known of how much of his own screenplay made it to the screen. The film was a huge international success, and won an Honorary Oscar for the best foreign language film of its year.

Although Boyer remained prolific throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, little of his subsequent work had as much impact as Forbidden Games. His 1962 film La Guerre des Boutons, however, was remade by producer David Puttnam in 1994 as The War of the Buttons.

From the late 1950s until two years before his death, Brasseur appeared in overall 150 film and television productions. One of his film roles was as Arthur in Jean-Luc Godard's Bande à part (1964). Brasseur played the title role in the early 1970s historical crime television series The New Adventures of Vidocq. A big commerical success were the comedies La Boum (1980) and La Boum 2 (1982), in which he played the father of Sophie Marceau's teenage character.

Renowned for playing outsized characters, Brasseur is probably best known in the anglophone world for his (semi-fictionalised) portrayal of the actor Frédérick Lemaître in Les Enfants du Paradis (Children of Paradise, 1945) and as Docteur Génessier (more subdued) in the horror film Eyes Without a Face (Les Yeux sans visage, 1960) co-starring with Alida Valli.

He is considered a master of the modern chanson.

Although he recorded most of his songs in French and occasionally in Dutch, he became an influence on English-speaking songwriters and performers, such as Scott Walker, David Bowie, Alex Harvey, Marc Almond, Neil Hannon, and Rod McKuen. English translations of his songs were recorded by many performers, including Bowie, Walker, Ray Charles, Judy Collins, John Denver, The Kingston Trio, Nina Simone, Shirley Bassey, James Dean Bradfield, Frank Sinatra, and Andy Williams.

Brel was a successful actor, appearing in 10 films. He directed two films, one of which, Le Far West, was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973. Having sold over 25 million records worldwide, Brel is the third best-selling Belgian recording artist of all time. Brel married Thérèse ""Miche"" Michielsen in 1950, and the couple had three children. He also had a romantic relationship with actress and dancer Maddly Bamy from 1972 until his death in 1978.

Jacques Romain Georges Brel was born on 8 April 1929 in Schaerbeek, Brussels, to Élisabeth ""Lisette"" (née Lambertine) and Romain Brel. He came from a family of Flemish descent (who had adopted the French language); part of his family originated in Zandvoorde, near Ypres. His father worked for Cominex, an import–export firm, and later became co-director of a company that manufactured cardboard. Jacques and his older brother Pierre grew up in an austere household, and attended a Catholic primary school, École Saint-Viateur, run by the order of Saint Viator. Remembered as a courteous and manageable pupil, Brel did well in reading and writing, but struggled through arithmetic and Dutch. The boys were also members of the local Boy Scout troop, and enjoyed their time at summer camp and on family outings to the North Sea coast. In Brussels, the family lived at 138 Avenue du Diamant in Schaerbeek, then moved to 26 Boulevard Belgica in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, and finally settled at 7 Rue Jacques-Manne in Anderlecht. Brel was close to his mother, fascinated by her generosity and sense of humour, which he inherited. ...

Brialy was born in Aumale (now Sour El-Ghozlane), French Algeria, where his father was stationed with the French Army. Brialy moved to mainland France with his family in 1942. He was an alumnus of the Prytanée National Militaire. When he was 21 years old, he went to Paris to work as an actor.

In 1956, Brialy acted in his first role in the short film Le coup du berger (Fool's Mate) by Jacques Rivette.

By the late 1950s, he'd become one of the most prolific actors in the French nouvelle vague and a star. He appeared in films of nouvelle vague directors such as Claude Chabrol (Le Beau Serge, 1958; Les Cousins, 1959), Louis Malle (Ascenseur pour l'échafaud, 1958; Les Amants, 1958), François Truffaut (Les 400 Coups, 1959), Jean-Luc Godard, (Une femme est une femme, 1961), Éric Rohmer (Claire's Knee, 1970), as well as in films of other filmmakers such as Jean Renoir (Elena et les hommes 1958), Roger Vadim (La ronde, 1964), Philippe de Broca (Le Roi de cœur, 1966), Luis Buñuel (Le Fantôme de la liberté, 1974), and Claude Lelouch (Robert et Robert, 1978).

In 2006, he appeared in his last role, as the eponymous character of the TV film Monsieur Max, directed by Gabriel Aghion. Godard described him as ""the French Cary Grant,"" while Brialy's self-described ""life models"" had reportedly been actor Sacha Guitry and director Jean Cocteau.

Brialy directed a number of films, including Églantine in 1971, which was loosely inspired by his own memories of a happy childhood spent in Chambellay with his grandparents, and Les volets clos (Closed shutters) in 1972.

He owned the restaurant L'Orangerie, on the Île Saint-Louis; he'd also worked as a TV presenter, a singer, and a radio host. During the presentation of one of his books, Brialy described himself this way: ""I'm a boy who got lucky enough to do what I love in life"".

Brialy, in 1959, acquired a château in the commune of Monthyon, near Paris. There, he accommodated and entertained many friends from the cinema and the theatre, such as Jean Marais, Pierre Arditi, and Romy Schneider whom he'd met during the 1958 production of the film Christine.

He lived in the staff accommodation of the girls' school in Argenteuil where his mother was a teacher. In his youth, Bruel aspired to be a football player, but decided instead to pursue singing after seeing Michel Sardou in 1975.

His first success came as an actor, in 1979's Le Coup de sirocco. He continued acting in films, on television, and in the theater while pursuing his singing career. His first single, ""Vide"" (""Empty""), released in 1982, was not a success, but the follow-up, ""Marre de cette nana-là"" (""Fed up with that chick""), was a hit.

In 2003, just before his partner, the writer and playwright Amanda Sthers, gave birth to his first child, Oscar, on 19 August, he changed his name to Bruel-Benguigui, combining his stage name with his birth name.

It sold two million copies and made Bruel France's best paid singer of the year. At the beginning of 2005, in response to the South Asian tsunami of 26 December 2004, Bruel wrote the song ""Et puis la terre"" with Marie-Florence Gros, with whom he had begun a long-term collaboration in 1998, to benefit the Red Cross. His latest album, ""Des souvenirs devant"", was his fourth chart-topper in France.

Bruel is a world-class professional poker player. He won a World Series of Poker bracelet in 1998 for the $5,000 Limit Hold'em event. As of 2009. he has earned more than $900,000 in tournament play, of which his ten cash winnings at the WSOP account for $411,659. He also comments on the World Poker Tour in France.

Gerlando Buzzanca (born August 24, 1935 in Palermo) is an Italian comedy actor.

He left high school in Palermo when he was 16 years old, and moved to Rome to pursue his dream of becoming an actor. In order to survive, he took many jobs: waiter, furniture mover, and a brief appearance as a slave in the film Ben-Hur.

In his long career he often interpreted the role of the average Italian immigrant from southern Italy, who slowly began to enjoy moderate success during the years of the Italian economic miracle. His films showcased all the freshness of the 1960s, the 1970s and the heavier transition to the 1980s, focusing on the common life in several Italian cities such as Rome, Verona or Milan, balanced between personal happiness and professional achievement.

Buzzanca often interpreted roles of a subordinate white collar worker, with a heavy vein of machismo, as a frustrated employee who tries to redeem his dull existence with his virility. He became famous for his role in the film Il merlo maschio, (The Male Blackbird), where in a provincial environment of cultural importance, the philharmonic orchestra of the Arena di Verona, he vents out his own frustrations, indulging into candaulism when he induces his bride to expose her naked body in the middle of a bridge in Verona.

Some critics, in a lighter vein, have defined Buzzanca as a ""Homo eroticus"": a human being halfway between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens, who risked extinction in the 1970s because of the harsh struggle with feminism activists. Today, even though much less so, this male type is still found among Italian males.

Buzzanca's fame is greater in foreign countries than in his native land, and in countries as France, Japan, Greece, Israel, Spain and Switzerland he is a renowned international stereotype of the Italian provincialotto, elegant, naif, always causing mischief, and not obtaining anything from it.

Marie-Pierre Casey was born on 24 January 1937 in Le Creusot. From the age of nine, she was educated at a boarding school in Charolais with her sister. It was there that she discovered her passion for theatre. Her first role was Doc, the leader of the seven dwarfs in the Grimm brothers' fairy tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, performed for the end of year celebration organised by the nuns.

She studied at the Conservatoire de Lyon and at Cours Simon in Paris, before starting at the cabarets of the Rive Gauche.

In the early 1950s, Marie-Pierre Casey had a small role in the film Forbidden Games directed by René Clément (1952), where she appeared as a shadow.

In 1960, she appeared briefly as a nurse in the film Certains l'aiment froide by Jean Bastia. In 1967, she played a cashier at the Royal Garden in Playtime by Jacques Tati.

In 1970, she appeared in three movies: The Things of Life by Claude Sautet, Children of Mata Hari by Jean Delannoy, and Le Cinéma de papa by Claude Berri.

In 1980, she became known across France for her role in the TV advert for the Johnson cleaning product Pledge (named Pliz in France). In the advert, Casey, dressed as a cleaning lady, sprays the product on a large board table, puts on an apron and proceeds to slide down the table on her stomach. She says ""It's better that way, because I wouldn't do that every day"", which made the advert a real success amongst television viewers. The role also brought her to the attention of Jean Becker, who noticed her during an advertising awards ceremony and subsequently offered her a role.

Robert Castel began as a musician, tar player, then guitarist, accompanying his father, composer violinist, and singer of light French-Arab songs. Young actor in the troupe of the Regional Center of Dramatic Art of Algiers, Robert Castel plays the role of Robert Le Bègue in the theatrical improvisation show on the life of the pieds-noirs, La Famille Hernandez, which is created by Geneviève Baïlac on September 17, 1957 in Paris. Having cut his teeth in music hall, Robert Castel began his film career at the age of 24 in Les Amants De Demain by Marcel Blistène, then in Un témoin dans la ville by Édouard Molinaro.

In 1962, Robert Castel left the newly independent Algeria and settled in Paris with Lucette Sahuquet (who died in 1987), whom he married. The couple inaugurated their sketches as a duo that year, notably at the Olympia where they opened for Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich and Philippe Clay. In the 1970s, the comedian, lively and provocative, did a lot of television sketches with his favorite partner and Enrico Macias. For the big screen, this dark-haired comedian, with a clear forehead, who speaks with his hands, abandoned his favorite register. Having become the figure of ""pied-noir humor"" in France, he played alongside Edith Piaf in Les Amants de demain by Marcel Blistène, Pierre Richard in Le Grand Blond avec une chaussure noire by Yves Robert, and Isabelle Huppert in Dupont Lajoie by Yves Boisset. In 1982, he made a notable appearance in Algerian cinema by playing in Hassan taxi, directed by Mohamed Slim Riad, alongside Rouiched (Ahmed Ayad), Ouardia Hamitouche and Sidali Kouiret. He appeared in more than thirty films in total, until the early 2000s.

Robert Castel kept a low profile for a few years before returning to the stage, this time in a musical, in 2007 thanks to the El-Gusto project. This project, which seeks to bring together Algerian, Jewish and Muslim musicians who were part of Hadj M'hamed El Anka's Algiers Chaâbi orchestra in the early 1950s, resulted in a documentary film that won international awards, the recording of an album and an international tour that took a troupe of 42 musicians to countries such as France, Morocco, Tunisia, Switzerland, Belgium, the United States and the Netherlands.

In 2008, Robert Castel signed his autobiography, Je pose 75 [son âge], mais je retaîtres tout. He returned to the stage in 2013 to present his last one-man show, ""Nostalgérie"".

Sergio Castellitto was born in Rome in 1953, to parents from Molise and Abruzzo, Southern Italy. After graduating from the Silvio D'Amico National Academy of Dramatic Art in 1978, he began his theatrical career in Italian public theater with Shakespeare's Measure for Measure at the Teatro di Roma and with roles in other plays such as La Madre by Brecht, Merchant of Venice, and Candelaio by Giordano Bruno. At the Teatro di Genova he starred in the roles of Tuzenbach in Chekhov's Three Sisters and Jean in Strindberg's Miss Julie, both under the direction of Otomar Krejka. In the coming years, he also starred in such theatrical productions as L'infelicità senza desideri and Piccoli equivoci at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto. He also appeared in Barefoot in the Park by Neil Simon. During his years in the theatre, he worked alongside many famous actors, including Luigi Squarzina, Aldo Trionfo, and Enzo Muzii.

Castellitto began his film career in 1983 beside Marcello Mastroianni and Michel Piccoli in The General of the Dead Army by Luciano Tovoli. He interpreted many films like Sembra morto...ma è solo svenuto directed by Felice Farina, Piccoli equivoci by Ricky Tognazzi and Stasera a casa di Alice by Carlo Verdone. He became more famous with the films The Great Pumpkin by Francesca Archibugi and The Star Maker by Giuseppe Tornatore.

In the late 1980s, Castellitto appeared in several Italian television miniseries, including Un siciliano in Sicilia (1987), Cinque storie inquietanti (1987), Piazza Navona (1988), Cinéma (1988), and Come stanno bene insieme (1989). He also appeared in the miniseries Victoire, ou la douleur des femmes (2000).

Success arrived with the films La famiglia, L'ultimo bacio, Caterina in the Big City, My Mother's Smile, Mostly Martha, and especially with Don't Move, written by his wife Margaret Mazzantini. Other films that he interpreted include Il regista di matrimoni by Marco Bellocchio and La stella che non c'è by Gianni Amelio.

In France, Castellitto played the male lead opposite Jeanne Balibar in Jacques Rivette's Va savoir (2001). His most recent accomplishment as an actor has been in his role as Padre Pio: Miracle Man, arguably the defining role of his career.

The first film that he directed is Libero Burro, followed by Don't Move. He played the role of the antagonist, King Miraz, in the film The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.

His most recent film as director was Twice Born, which played at the Toronto Film Festival (2012), where it was not well received by much of the English speaking press.

Most recently, Castellitto appeared in the television series In Treatment in the role of Giovanni.

Castellitto is married to Margaret Mazzantini with four children, one of these is Pietro, actor and film director himself.

Chamfort was a promising pianist in his youth, and the piano became his instrument of choice. His first band The Dreamers had minor success as a repertory jazz outfit, and was followed by a typically sixties rock music group Murator.

Chamfort met famed writer and producer Jacques Dutronc, who proposed to help him with future works for television and film, and it is with Dutronc that Chamfort's career expanded. After being discovered by Dutronc, it was with Claude François and ultimately Serge Gainsbourg that he made a number of albums, including his first album recorded as Alain Chamfort: Poses. A single from the album, ""Manureva"" remains one of the most famous songs to date by Chamfort, whose subject is the yacht Manureva which disappeared with her skipper Alain Colas in 1978.

Chamfort composed for the cinema; he worked with Jean-Pierre Mocky and with Arnaud Sélignac. As an actor, he appeared in the short Men/Toys/Girl in 2001. In 2004, he became a member of the board of directors of SACEM.

He first established his reputation in the 1920s as a director of silent films in which comedy was often mingled with fantasy. He went on to make some of the most innovative early sound films in France, before going abroad to work in the UK and USA for more than a decade. Returning to France after World War II, he continued to make films that were characterised by their elegance and wit, often presenting a nostalgic view of French life in earlier years. He was elected to the Académie française in 1960. Clair's best known films include The Italian Straw Hat (1928), Under the Roofs of Paris (1930), Le Million (1931), À nous la liberté (1931), I Married a Witch (1942), and And Then There Were None (1945).

In 1924, while Clair was working on Ciné-sketch for the theatre with France Picabia, he first met a young actress, Bronja Perlmutter, who subsequently appeared in his film Le Voyage imaginaire (1926) premiered at the newly opened Studio des Ursulines. They married in 1926, and their son, Jean-François, was born in 1927. 

René Clair died at home on 15 March 1981, and he was buried privately at Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois.

Clair's reputation as a film-maker underwent a considerable reevaluation during the course of his own lifetime: in the 1930s he was widely seen as one of France's greatest directors, alongside Renoir and Carné, but thereafter his work's artifice and detachment from the realities of life fell increasingly from favour. The avant-gardism of his first films, and especially Entr'acte, had given him a temporary notoriety, and a grounding in surrealism continued to underlie much of his comedy work. It was however the imaginative manner in which he overcame his initial scepticism about the arrival of sound which established his originality, and his first four sound films brought him international fame.

Clair's years of working in the UK and USA made him still more widely known but did not show any marked development in his style or thematic concerns. It was in the post-war films that he made on his return to France that some critics have observed a new maturity and emotional depth, accompanied by a prevailing sense of melancholy but still framed by the elegance and wit that characterised his earlier work.

However, in the 1950s the critics who heralded the arrival of the French New Wave, especially those associated with Cahiers du Cinéma, found Clair's work old-fashioned and academic. The paradox of Clair's reputation has been further heightened by those commentators who have seen François Truffaut as the French cinema's true successor to Clair, notwithstanding the occasions of their mutual disdain.",1898-11-11,1981-03-15,33166.0,Directing,"Paris, France",2.13,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//m6pYOo5Yp2N4i6egvVFXYOnmS82.jpg

Maurice Clavel was born on 10 November 1920 in Frontignan, Hérault to a family headed by a father who was a pharmacist. This conservative milieu of small shopkeepers in Languedoc led him to be an activist in the French Popular Party (FPP) in his hometown of Frontignan.

A brilliant pupil, he got into the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris. There he became acquainted with Trotskyist Jean-Toussaint Desanti and Maurrassian Pierre Boutang. The latter, having been appointed in the Secretariat of Public Instruction, invited him to serve by his side under Marshal Philippe Pétain. Having just gotten his certificate of morale and sociology in Montpellier, Maurice Clavel accepted but was soon disillusioned. While preparing a thesis on Immanuel Kant, he then joined the Résistance (1942). As head the French Forces of the Interior of Eure-et-Loir, he took part in the liberation of Chartres where he greeted General Charles de Gaulle on the cathedral's forecourt.

At the Libération, he denounced the blind epuration and tried to save the heads of Robert Brasillach and Drieu La Rochelle. That did not prevent him from being a fervent activist in the Rally of the French People (RPF) whose acerbic criticism of communism got him to be accused by the French Communist Party (PCF) of being ""Goebbels' voice"". He then founded with Henri d'Astier de La Vigerie and André Figueras a newspaper called L'Essor. Meanwhile, he wrote plays directed by Jean Vilar like Les Incendiaires (The Incendiaries) in 1947 or La Terrasse de midi (The Noon Terrace) in 1949. But those failed, and as he was torn apart after breaking his relationship with the actor Silvia Monfort, Clavel accepted a professor tenure in the Carnot high school in Dijon.

Barely liked by his superiors, he soon got back to theatrical works when, in 1951, Jean Vilar appointed him as secretary-general of the Théâtre National Populaire. But his new play Malsameda (1954) as well as his first novel Une fille pour l'été (A Girl for the Summer, 1955) turned out to be failures too.

From 1955, Clavel started his career as a journalist writing in Combat. Protesting, among other things, against the invasion of Hungary by Soviet tanks in 1956, and the use of torture in Algeria, he got involved with left-wing Gaullists in the Democratic Union of Labour in 1959. Meanwhile, he went back to teaching as philosophy professor in Camille Sée and Buffon high school in Paris, from 1960 to 1963. With Emmanuel Berl, he presented a daily radio programme Qui êtes-vous? (Who are you?). But after the refusal by managers of the radio station to grant Jean Daniel a right of reply about Algeria, he resigned. The following year, after publishing Le Temps de Chartres (The Times of Chartres), he ceased his regular contribution to Combat. However he kept supporting General De Gaulle's position on Algeria, who entrusted him to engage in a dialogue with Messali Hadj. ...

De 1962 à 1965, il suit les cours du Centre dramatique de l'Est alors sous la direction d'Hubert Gignoux, Paul Lefèvre et Claude Petitpierre. Parallèlement, il continue l'étude de l'orgue, du clavecin et du piano.

En 1971, il participe aux débuts du Théâtre de l'Espérance avec Jean Jourdheuil etJean-Pierre Vincent, puis, en 1976, rejoint l’école du TNS (l'école supérieure d’art dramatique de Strasbourg) que dirige le même Jean-Pierre Vincent. De 1985 à 1987, il est pensionnaire à la Comédie-Française. Philippe Clévenot joue aussi bien le répertoire classique que le théâtre contemporain. Ainsi le voit-on dans Le Misanthropede Molière ou Macbeth de Shakespeare (deux mises en scène de Jean-Pierre Vincent) ; dans Le Prince de Hombourg deKleist (mise en scène de Matthias Langhoff), La Cruche cassée du même Kleist (mise en scène de Bernard Sobel) ; dansL'École des femmes de Molière (mise en scène de Bernard Sobel), Le Neveu de Rameau de Diderot (mise en scène de Jean-Marie Simon), dans Artaud Mômo ou la conférence du Vieux Colombier et Histoire vécue d'Artaud Mômo d'Antonin Artaud, où il interprète l'auteur, dans Un barrage contre le Pacifique de Marguerite Duras ou encore Dans la jungle des villesde Brecht (mise en scène de Stéphane Braunschweig), dans la Vie de l’égoïste Fätzer, du même Brecht (sous la direction de Bernard Sobel), dans Rumeur à Wall Street de Bernard Chatellier, d’après le Bartleby de Melville (mise en scène deBérangère Bonvoisin), ou bien Pionniers à Ingolstadt de Marieluise Fleisser. En tant que metteur en scène, on lui doit notamment Anna Christie d’Eugene O'Neill, à Genève, en 2000 — spectacle qui est repris au Théâtre Gérard Philipe, à Villeurbanne, en 2001. Par ailleurs, il a également écrit Celle qui ment, d'après la célèbre mystique italienne Angèle de Foligno. Son premier rôle au cinéma lui est offert par René Allio en 1970, dans Les Camisards. Il travaille ensuite avec de nombreux cinéastes, dont Bertrand Blier, Patrice Leconte ou encore Jean-Jacques Beineix. L’un de ses derniers films au cinéma estDisparus (1998), premier long métrage historique et politique d'un jeune réalisateur, Gilles Bourdos.

He adopted Coluche as a stage name at age 26, when he began his entertainment career. He became known for his irreverent attitude towards politics and the establishment, and he incorporated this into much of his material. He was one of the first major comedians to regularly use profanities as a source of humor on French television. He also founded the charity ""Les Restaurants du Coeur"" which still provides free meals and other products to people in need.

Colucci was born on 28 October 1944, just weeks after the Liberation of Paris, in a hospital in the 14th arrondissement of the city. His mother, Simone Bouyer (called ""Monette""), worked as a florist in the Boulevard du Montparnasse. His father, Honorio Colucci, from Casalvieri in Lazio, Italy, was a painter and decorator. His father died in 1947 at age 31 from poliomyelitis; his wife struggled thereafter to raise the young Michel and his sister (Danièle, 18 months older than Michel) on a meagre salary.

Coluche showed little promise at school, and left after completing his primary studies (June 1958). He tried various temporary jobs, and had several run-ins with authorities. During this time his mother bought him a guitar, which he taught himself to play. In 1964 he joined the 60th Infantry Regiment de Lons-le-Saunier, but was imprisoned for insubordination. On his return to civilian life, he worked in his mother's florist shop which she had been able to open on rue d'Aligre, and later in a larger shop which she opened near la Gare de Lyon. He found this work dull, and suddenly quit, which caused a long-lasting breach with his mother.

At the end of the 1960s he tried his luck as a singer in cafes, then turned to comedy.

In 1969, with Romain Bouteille he was present at the start of the Café de la Gare, meeting place of a group of young comedic actors practically all of whom were to become famous: Patrick Dewaere, Henri Guybet, Miou-Miou, Martin Lamotte, etc. Among the patrons of the Café de la Gare were Georges Moustaki, Raymond Devos, Jean Ferrat, Jacques Brel, Leni Escudero, Pierre Perret and Jean Yanne. Later they were joined by Gérard Lanvin, Renaud, Rufus, Diane Kurys, Coline Serreau, Anémone, Gérard Depardieu, Thierry Lhermitte, Josiane Balasko and Gérard Jugnot.

Coluche's first sketch C'est l'histoire d'un mec (It's the story of a guy) was about the difficulties of telling a funny story. He quickly found success, but alcohol problems forced him to leave the group.

He went on to found another group, Le vrai chic parisien (The true Parisian chic) and it was then that he met his future wife, Véronique Kantor. They married in 1975 and had two sons, Marius and Romain Colucci. His behaviour and addictions forced him to leave the new group and launch his solo career.

It was at this point that he began to dress in his well-known outfit of white tennis shoes, blue striped overalls, a bright yellow T-shirt and round glasses. He became famous with his parody of a TV game (Le Schmilblick). He was sacked by the radio stations Europe 1 and Radio Monte Carlo for vulgarity. ...

Cosso's first film was the popular teen comedy-drama La Boum 2 (1982), in which he played Sophie Marceau's boyfriend. In the following years, he worked as an actor in film productions in France, Italy and the United States. During that time in the 1980s, he achieved a considerable status as a teen idol in many parts of Europe. Among his most successful roles was the part of Mizio in the romantic comedy Cinderella '80 (1984).

Cosso continued his acting career after the 1980s. In the American film An American Werewolf in Paris (1997) he had a supporting role as the werewolf Claude. He also appeared in leading roles in television productions including Les Cœurs brûlés (1992) and Les Yeux d'Hélène (1994). Between 2000 and 2002, Pierre Cosso played in the theatre production Ladies Night at the Théâtre Rive Gauche in Paris, then on tour. His last acting credit in front of a camera (until at least 2020) was for the Italian television series Anna e i cinque (2008-2011), in which he and Sabrina Ferilli played the leading roles. In August 2019, the actor returned to the stage with the play Nuit d'ivresse, a cult play from the 1980s written by Josiane Balasko. The play he directed sold out at the theater of the Maison de la Culture in Papeete.

Pierre Cosso also recorded several 45s as a singer in the 1980s. The song ""Stay"", which he sung together with his Cinderella '80-co-star Bonnie Bianco, was successful: When the film was first shown in Germany in 1987, the single reached the No. 1 in the German Singles Charts. He continued his music career in the 2000s by making a radical turn through the ""ethnic electro-acoustic"" style. In November 2019, the actor returned to music with Le Gang des rêve, a title from the future album signed by the Cosso Gang, a musical group with a pop-rock tendency of which he is the frontman. The band performed in concert on 1 December 2019 in Tahiti and had success there.

The family father Cosso has semi-retired from acting and lives today in his adopted home French Polynesia, where he works as a skipper. He also has an internet blog in which he writes about his life in Polynesia.

Various TV magazines have devoted documentaries to him. In February 2016, he took part in the 11th edition of the Italian version of Dancing with the Stars called Ballando con le stelle.

He also had love affairs with actress Sophie Marceau, the model Nathalie Marquay and the singer Zazie.

He was born in Vittel and came to prominence when he was cast by Sacha Guitry in Assassins et voleurs (1956) (Assassins and Robbers). Following this he turned to acting in cinema roles and soon gained celebrity status with his role as Antoine Péralou in Le Triporteur (1957) (The Tricycle).

A game addict, he often acted only for money in films that did not stretch his acting ability. He explained this by noting he did not read the script (or, on occasion, know the title) of the work in which he was to act.

He played Major Archibald in the 1974 film Don't Touch the White Woman!.

He had hoped to return to theatre acting in Hold Up in September 2005 but ill-health prevented this. At age 80, he died in Neuilly-sur-Seine from complications of lung cancer.

Bruno Cremer was born in Saint-Mandé, Val-de-Marne, in the eastern suburbs of Paris, France. His mother, Jeanne Rullaert, a musician, was of Belgian Flemish origin and his father, Georges, was a businessman from Lille who, though born French, had taken out Belgian nationality after the French armed forces refused to accept him for service in the First World War. Bruno himself opted for French nationality when he reached the age of 18. His childhood was largely spent in Paris.

Bruno attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school. Having completed his secondary studies, he followed an interest in acting which had interested him since the age of 12 and trained in acting from 1952 at France's highly selective Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique (English: French National Academy of Dramatic Arts).

His career began with ten years spent acting in live theatre, playing roles drawn from works of Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde and Jean Anouilh. Aged already 30, he created the role of Thomas Becket in the 1959 world premiere of Anouilh's Becket, and held Anouilh in veneration all his life. Later Cremer played Max in a French production of Bent by Martin Sherman in 1981. He regarded his basic profession as that of a stage actor, though he gravitated firmly to films.

It was in 1957 that Cremer had his first credited part in a film, Quand la femme s'en mêle (When a woman meddles), which starred Alain Delon. However, it was in 1965 that Cremer's career really began to prosper, with the film La 317e section, (The 317th Platoon), directed by Pierre Schoendoerffer and set in Indochina during the French colonial wars. From then onwards, Cremer became a popular actor and appeared in over 110 productions for cinema and television.

While Cremer tried to avoid labels and typecasting, he tended to be offered tough-guy roles, often military men. Examples from various points in his career include Section spéciale (1975), La légion saute sur Kolwezi (1980) and Là-haut, un roi au-dessus des nuages (2004).

Special Section (French original title: Section spéciale), released in 1975, is about a kangaroo court set up in collaborationist Vichy France to ensure judicial convictions of innocent people so as to mollify the Nazis. A French language film directed by the Greek-French film director Costa-Gavras, it features Cremer as Lucien Sampaix, a Communist-leaning journalist.

The 1980 film La légion saute sur Kolwezi (English Operation Leopard), directed by Raoul Coutard, is a documentary-style portrayal of a real-life operation headed by the French Foreign Legion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1978 to rescue foreign hostages. Cremer plays a military commander. Pierre Schoendoerffer’s 2004 film Là-haut, un roi au-dessus des nuages (Above the Clouds), based on his own novel, Là-haut. Cremer played the Colonel. ...

His family were wealthy industrialists. Oliveira attended school in Galicia, Spain and his goal as a teenager was to become an actor. He enrolled in Italian film-maker Rino Lupo's acting school at age 20, but later changed his mind when he saw Walther Ruttmann's documentary Berlin: Symphony of a City. This prompted him to direct his first film, also a documentary, titledDouro, Faina Fluvial (1931). He also acted in the second Portuguese sound film, A Canção de Lisboa (1933). His first feature film came much later, in 1942. Aniki-Bóbó, a portrait of Oporto's street children, was a commercial failure when it opened, and its merit only came to be recognised over time. This drawback forced Oliveira to abandon other film projects he was involved in, and to dedicate himself to running his family vineyard. He re-emerged onto the film scene in 1956 with The Artist and the City, a work that marked a turning point in Oliveira's conception of the cinema. In 1963, O Acto de Primavera (The Rite of Spring), a documentary depicting an annual passion play, marked a turning point for his career. This was shortly followed by A caça (The Hunt), a grim feature film that contrasted with the happy tones of his previous documentary. Despite the widespread acclaim garnered by both films, he would not return to the director's seat until the 1970s. Since 1990 (when he turned 82), he has made at least one film each year.  Oliveira has said that he direct movies for the sheer pleasure of doing it, regardless of critical reaction. He maintains a quiet life away from the spotlights, despite multiple honours such as those of the Cannes, Venice and Montreal film festivals. He has been awarded two Career Golden Lions in 1985 and 2004 and a golden palm for his lifetime achievements in 2008.",1908-12-11,2015-04-02,81749.0,Directing,"Porto, Portugal",1.3929,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//ehZkNJjHu1mtq5Aa6OG9gtkODlc.jpg

Jennifer began her theatrical career at an early age. At 18 she was spotted by director Irina Brook, who gave her the role of Juliet in a stage production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. After a success run at the Théâtre national de Chaillot in Paris, the play went on tour throughout France, and then abroad for many months.

Jennifer next played a young teenager in love and on the run, the leading part in Steve Suissa's Cavale (Love on the Run). She is continuing to extend the range of her on-stage performances at the Commedia dell'arte.

Afterward, she began to show interest in cinematography. For this she next appeared in Steve Suissa's ""L'Amour Dangereux"" (Love on the run) also known as Trop Plain D'amour and Cavale, opposite Nicolas Cazalé. Jennifer Decker played Noémie, a young teenager who goes on the run with Simon, a boy who's on the fast track of life.

Although Jennifer tends to focus on feature films, she also shows interest in short-films as well. For this she was seen next in Pierre Bernier's, Jeux de Haute Société (2003), a short-film, in which she plays Madame Blanche.

She started in the renowned French series Une Femme d'Honneur (2005), in the episode of Les Liens du Sang, playing as Laëtitia Cervantes, a very intense and interesting character.

Jennifer completed four films in 2006. She started the year with Jeune Homme, a Swiss film, in which she plays Elodie Dumoulin, a young artist, who takes drawing lessons and meets the lead character, Sebastian, played by Matthias Schoch. Sebastian is a new transfer student from abroad who came to study in France. Sebastian stayed with a French family who, coincidentally, is Elodie's family.

After Jeune Homme, Jennifer starred in Les Amants Du Flore, an acclaimed film, directed by Ilan Duran Cohen, starring Anna Mouglalis. Jennifer played Marina, a sensitive student, who at first fell in love with her teacher, Simone de Beauvoir, but later fell for a lover who died due to the consequences of the second world war.

nm0217735,Danièle Delorme,1926.0,2015.0,"actress,producer,archive_footage","tt0041414,tt0055852,tt2261749,tt0144995","Gabrielle Danièle Marguerite Andrée Girard (9 October 1926 – 17 October 2015), known by her stage name Danièle Delorme, was a French actress and film producer, famous for her roles in films directed by Marc Allégret, Julien Duvivier or Yves Robert.

Delorme was born in Levallois-Perret, Hauts-de-Seine, one of four children to the well-known painter, poster-maker and theater-designer André Girard and his wife Andrée (nee Jouan). Girard maintained a studio in Venice in 1936–37 and in Manhattan in 1938. Back in France he was not called up in 1939. After the Battle of France, M. Girard removed to Antibes, then a free-zone and set up a network which provided recruiting and spying work for the French resistance. It was during this time that young Delorme began her acting career.

In 1940 at the age of 14 Delorme began acting and played a series of minor roles before she began acting in film. Two years later, owing to her father's contacts, she was able at 16 years old (at the time using the name Danièle Girard) to secure a bit part in The Beautiful Adventure (La Belle aventure (1942)).

Two years later director Marc Allégret again used Delorme, this time in a large role. This time she performed on the stage name she would use for the rest of her career, Danièl Delorme. One story developed that she took the name in order to hide from the Gestapo her relationship to her father. But the suggestion came from character actor Bernard Blier, who performed with her in her second film to take the name from the heroine of Victor Hugo's play Marion Delorme. (Delorme would co-star with Blier two decades later in the philosophical courtroom criminal drama, The Seventh Juror (Le septième juré (1962)).

During the first decade of her career Delorme played delicate, demure, bright young women, roles for which she was physically fitted. Her first husband Daniel Gélin, who also performed in The Beautiful Adventure, said she had ""the face of a little girl, an upturned nose with passionate nostrils, the lips of a child, the body of a woman and a certain way about her that turns heads."" Richard W. Seaver of the New York Times described her as ""a winsome wisp of an actress, with her soft smile and grey eyes."" These features landed her a breakthrough role in Miquette et sa mère (1949). In 1949, she also played the title role in Gigi (1949 film), before Leslie Caron's success in the same role in the American (musical) version (Gigi (1958 film)) .

Also notable was her performance as femme fatale in Julien Duvivier's Voici le temps des assassin (1956) (Deadlier Than the Male in the US and Twelve Hours to Live in the UK), co-starring with Jean Gabin.

In 1960 Delorme joined more than 140 intellectuals, teachers, writers and celebrities in signing a manifesto supporting the right of French conscripts to refuse military service in Algeria. As a result, the French government on 28 September issued a ban against all signatories from appearing on state-run radio or television or in state-run theaters. At the same time the information minister said that another cabinet order was in preparation that would deny government funding to any film project in which any signatory appeared. ...

Jean-Michel Bertrand Delpech was born the 26th January in 1946 in Courbevoie, a city located in the Parisian suburbs. Part of the baby boom, he was the son of Bertrand Charles Delpech, a chrome metal plater and Christiane Cécile Marie Josselin, a housewife. He had two younger sisters named Catherine and Martine.

His maternal family (Josselin) are winegrowers in Gyé-sur-Seine in the Aube department. His father's ancestral home is in Sologne, more specifically in Dhuizon, where his hairdresser grandfather lived and also in La Ferté-Saint-Cyr, where his uncles and cousins worked as grocers, loggers and farmers. The young Michel spent weekends and holidays with his provincial family, sometimes working in his aunt’s grocery store.

Its parents having moved to Cormeilles-en-Parisis in Seine-et-Oise (today known as Val-d’Oise), Jean-Michel Delpech studied in the Chabanne college and in the Pontoise’s Camille-Pissarro high-school from 1961 to 1964.

As a teenager he got passionate about famous classic fingers such as Luis Mariano, and then for the great names from the 1950s such as Gilbert Nécaud and Charles Aznavour. In 1963, in high school, he created a little orchestra with his schoolmates.

Before taking his final exams, he left high school in January 1964 to focus on singing. He took a chance by attending an audition in Paris to join the disque Vogue record company. At age 18, he released his first record called Anatole, and met composer Roland Vincent. While going to Roland’s house based in Saint-Cloud for a working session, he rethinks about his high school years and about the café he used to go with his mates after the school day. On the train, between Saint Lazare and Saint Cloud train station, he writes the lyrics of Chez Laurette, for which Roland Vincent felt seduced and inspired and quickly found a melody. Released the 1st of May 1965, during the yé yé period, this nostalgic teenager music wasn't a success at its release, but thanks to the numerous radio streams, he started to experience a slight celebrity.

In 1965, Michel Delpech attended a musical comedy Copains-Clopant, which was featured for 6 months, before at the Michodière theater and then at the Gymnase Theater in Paris: the integration of the Chez Laurette Music helped him to be famous. During this musical comedy, Delpech meets Chantal SImon, who he sang a song with. Then he’ll marry her at the age of 20 in 1966.

The same year, under the Festival Label, he recorded its 2nd 45 laps: Inventaire 1966, new stepping stone towards the star status. As Jacques Prévert and as a tribute to the poetry, he compiles in the verse of the music, a list of news such as the Vietnam war, the minijupe, the Courrèges boots, the Cacharel trend, the flower shirts,etc. Still in 1966, he made the first part during 38 shows of Jacques Brell who said goodbye to the Olympia. ...

Some other notable film roles include Elsa in Otto Preminger's Bonjour Tristesse (1958), alongside Deborah Kerr and David Niven, and as Milady de Winter in Les Trois Mousquetaires (1961).

A ""veteran of cinema"" who started as one of the blond sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s, she managed to avoid typecasting by exploring many film genres including thrillers, westerns, comedies, swashbucklers, period films and even pepla, such as Romulus and the Sabines (1961) opposite Roger Moore or Gold for the Caesars (1963).

Demongeot also has a cult following based on the Fantomas trilogy, as Hélène Gurn opposite Louis de Funès and Jean Marais: Fantômas (1964), Fantômas Unleashed (1965) and Fantômas Against Scotland Yard (1967).

Born in Albert (Somme), Depraz was a bass at the Paris Opéra until 1971. He took part in the premieres of operas by Marcel Landowski and Sergei Prokofiev. He also appeared as an actor, first on television, where he played the role of Ursus in The Man who laughs by Jean Kerchbron, then on the big screen.

Depraz entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1947 where he attended the classes of Fernand Francell for singing, Louis Musy for the stage and René Simon for theatre. He participated in the premieres of several operas: Marcel Landowski's Le Rire de Nils Halerius (1951) and Le Fou, Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites and, in concert version, Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel (1954). In the 1953 Paris premiere of The Rake's Progress at the Opéra-Comique Depraz was ""a splendid Nick Shadow"". He also sang in Bartók's Bluebeard's Castle, Verdi's Rigoletto, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Massenet's Don Quichotte and Thaïs among others. For his appearance as Méphistophélès in Monte Carlo in 1959 one reviewer commented ""Xavier Depraz, immensely tall, and surprisingly thin and angular for an operatic bass, produced a suitably resonant and cavernous voice, and histrionically was satisfyingly demonic"".

He also appeared at the French provincial opera houses, Glyndebourne and Venice, and was appointed a professor of opera at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1973.

In 1971, he began a career as an actor in film and television.

Born in Saint-Brieuc, Côtes-d'Armor, he was the son of French actress Mado Maurin. An actor from a young age, his career lasted more than 21 years until his suicide in Paris, in 1982.

Patrick Dewaere was the third child of an actor's family. His biological father, Michel Têtard, was a lyricist who had an affair with Dewaere's mother, Mado Maurin, who was married to Pierre-Marie Bourdeaux. Dewaere grew up believing Bourdeaux was his biological father. After Dewaere's parents divorced, his mother remarried Georges Collignon, who sexually abused Dewaere as a child. Under the direction of his mother, Dewaere, his four brothers and his sister performed in movies and television series. The family lived in Paris. Dewaere attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school.

One of his first TV appearances was in 1961, when he was 14 years old. He appeared in a video for the song ""Nuits d'Espagne"" by Dalida. Later, he was a promising and popular French actor in the late 1960s and 1970s.

At the age of 17, Dewaere learned that he was not the biological child of his mother’s ex-husband, Pierre-Marie Bourdeaux, but that of conductor and singer Michel Têtard. In 1968, he took the name of ""Dewaere"" which his maternal great-grandmother inspired him. A year earlier, he had met his first wife, Sotha, an actress who co-founded the Café de la Gare, an experimental theatre. They separated in 1970 but remained married for eleven years.

From 1968, he collaborated with the Café de la Gare, where he met Miou-Miou and Gérard Depardieu, with whom he made a breakthrough after many secondary roles in various films, in the scandalous comedy Going Places. Miou-Miou became Dewaere’s companion and the mother of his daughter Angèle (1974). She left Dewaere for singer Julien Clerc, shortly before the shooting of F...like Fairbanks, in which both play a couple in separation.

Patrick Dewaere became one of the most popular actors in French cinema in the 1970s. Between 1977 and 1982, he was nominated five times to the Césars in the ""Best Actor"" category, the most important award in France. In his work, Dewaere was restless and very conscientious, which may have caused his depressed mood. He also had serious drug problems, and it is known that he had been sexually abused as a child. He consolidated his status as a savage and ruthless actor in Alain Corneau’s cult film Série noire (1979). In his roles, Dewaere was long attached to the kind of young rebel. Only in his later films did his comic and dramatic diversity manifest itself. He often worked with director Bertrand Blier.

In 1980, Dewaere hit a journalist who had announced against his will his union with Elsa Chalier. Subsequently, the actor was ignored by the French press, his name was even abbreviated with his initials (P.D).

For eleven years Dewaere was married to French actress Sotha. In the early 1970s, he became the companion of French actress Miou-Miou, until they separated in 1976. They had one daughter. Shortly before the release of Paradis Pour Tous (1982), a black comedy where his character tries to commit suicide, the actor shot himself in his house in Paris. He was 35 years old. ...

In 1998, she left for France to work at the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord on Jean-Louis Sagot-Duvauroux's adaptation of the play Antigone. She appeared in several feature films including Sìa: Le Rêve du python2 (Special Jury Prize at Fespaco in 2001). In 2002, she fled a forced marriage with her cousin to join the Royal luxury company and spent six years in the troupe1. According to Jean-Luc Courcoult, ""She could sing a little, she could not play well, but I was looking for a temperament, something else"". In November 2006, she was chosen to play the leading female role of the Opéra du Sahel, in Bamako.

It was then that she was noticed by Cheick Tidiane Seck. She participated in the recording of Dee Dee Bridgewater's album. During this same period, she met Oumou Sangaré who asked her to record her album Seya. Fatoumata Diawara then decides to embark on the adventure of music and begins to work on her own repertoire. She also continues her experiences in the cinema, playing in particular in the film It's going to rain on Conakry by the Guinean director Cheick Fantamady Camara, where she plays the role of a young singer. In 2007, she played the role of Karaba in the musical Kirikou and Karaba, taken from the cartoon Kirikou and the witch by Michel Ocelot. At the same time, she is working on the disc of the musical. Cheick Tidiane Seck then offers him to record on his own Sabaly album. She has the opportunity to sing with Herbie Hancock (The Imagine project, Grammy Award in 20114) or Hank Jones. At the same time, she recorded on various discs.

She is committed against excision in her region of origin in Mali. In 2012, she managed the production of a music video against the occupation of the north of the country by jihadists, which led her to play in Timbuktu, a multi-Caesarized film in 2015.

In 2017, Fatoumata Diawara contributed to Matthieu Chedid's Malian project ""Lamomali"". In 2018, she released her second solo album Fenfo, produced by Matthieu Chedid.

Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett invite the Malian singer on a new excerpt from their collaborative series Song Machine in 2020 and feature her in the music video and song Sorry by the group Gorillaz.

In 2022, she plays in an opera by Damon Albarn and Abderrahmane Sissako, entitled Le Vol de Boli and dedicated to the theft of a Malian animist fetish by a French ethnologist and art critic, Michel Leiris, for the Musée de l'Homme . In one of his texts, The Phantom Africa, Michel Leiris expresses his shame at having stolen this fetish.

His father is from Cameroon; his mother is from France. Dieudonné initially achieved success with a Jewish comedian, Élie Semoun, humorously exploiting racial stereotypes. He campaigned against racism and was a candidate in the 1997 and 2001 legislative elections in Dreux against the National Front, the French far-right political party that he perceived as racist. On 1 December 2003, Dieudonné performed a sketch on a TV show about an Israeli settler whom he depicted as a Nazi. Some critics argued that he had ""crossed the limits of antisemitism"" and several organizations sued him for incitement to racial hatred. Dieudonné refused to apologize and denounced Zionism and the Jewish lobby. Dieudonné approached Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front political party that he had fought earlier, and the men became political allies and friends. Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson appeared in one of his shows in 2008. Dieudonné described Holocaust remembrance as ""memorial pornography"". Dieudonné was convicted in court eight times on antisemitism charges. Dieudonné subsequently found himself with increasing frequency banned from mainstream media, and many of his shows were cancelled by local authorities. Active on the internet and in his Paris theater, Dieudonné has continued to have a following. His quenelle signature gesture became notorious in 2013, particularly after footballer Nicolas Anelka used the gesture during a match in December 2013. His recent appearances and videos are often rants in which the ""Jewish lobby"" and ""Israel lobby"" are characterised as controlling things. After Dieudonné was recorded during a performance mocking a Jewish journalist, suggesting it was a pity that he was not sent to the gas chambers, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls stated that Dieudonné was ""no longer a comedian"" but was rather an ""anti-Semite and racist"" and that he would seek to ban all Dieudonné's public gatherings as a public safety risk. The ban on his shows has been upheld by French courts. Dieudonné has also been known to associate with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (President of Iran from 2005 to 2013), who has himself been accused of describing the Holocaust as a myth. On 25 February 2015 Ahmadinejad Tweeted ""Visiting an old friend, a great artist."" the tweet included photographs of himself and Dieudonné, arms around each other, smiling. The two also met in 2009 during a visit by Dieudonné to the Islamic Republic of Iran where they reportedly discussed their shared anti-Zionist views.

Dobtcheff was born in Nîmes, France, to a British mother (Vernon) and a father of Bulgarian descent (Dobtcheff). He attended Ascham Preparatory School in Eastbourne, Sussex, England, in the 1940s, where he won the Acting Cup. One of his many television roles was as the Chief Scientist in the Doctor Who story The War Games in 1969.

In his 2006 memoir Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins, British actor Rupert Everett describes an encounter with Dobtcheff on the boat train to Paris, and reveals his extraordinary reputation as the ""patron saint"" of the acting profession, stating that Dobtcheff ""was legendary not so much for his acting as for his magical ability to catch every first night in the country"". Widely travelled and prone to pop up in the most unlikely of locales, if unable to attend an opening night, Dobtcheff will still endeavour to send the cast a card wishing the production good luck.

Dobtcheff is set to appear in the upcoming Doctor Who audio drama The Children of Seth where he'll be playing the role of Shamur, set for release in December 2011.

It was there that he met Charles Dullin, a great man from the theater world who passed on his passion for the stage to him and made his cabaret-theatre debut in 1951 with Agnès Capri. Jacques Dufilho then begins by playing sketches before turning to the big screen. In 1939, he participated in Marc Allégret's project in the film ""Le Corsaire"" but the film remained unfinished. Jacques Dufilho is not worried about it as two years later, he plays the role of a lumberjack in André Zwobada's feature film ""Croisières Sidérales"".

Subsequently, the actor chained the roles in the cinema but it was in 1949 that he was noticed by the general public in ""La Ferme des Sept Péchés"" by Jean-Devaivre. Jacques Dufilho also went to the theater and went on stage for the first time in Dostoyevsky's play, ""The Brothers Karamazov"" directed by André Barsacq.

The year 1978 marks a new turning point in the career of Jacques Dufilho, with the film ""Le Crabe-Tambour"" by Pierre Schoendoerffer, thanks to his interpretation of the role of the chief mechanic in the film, he will be rewarded with a César in the Best Supporting Actor category. In 1980, he played Adrien Dussart in ""A bad son"" by Claude Sautet, which earned him a second César award, still in the same category. At the theater, in 1988 the actor was awarded the Molière du Comédien for his role in Herb Gardner's play ""Je Ne Suis Pas Rappaport"" directed by Georges Wilson. Over the years, Jacques Dufilho will play under the direction of Louis Malle, Claude Chabrol, André Hunebelle, Yves Robert and many others. In 1999, he played in ""C'est Quoi La Vie?"" by François Dupeyron, which earned him a new nomination for the Césars.

Bruno Dumont (born 1958, Bailleul, France) is a French film director. To date, he has directed ten feature films, all of which border somewhere between realistic drama and the avant-garde. His films have won several awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Two of Dumont's films have won the Grand Prix award: both L'Humanité (1999) and Flandres (2006). Dumont's Hadewijch won the 2009 Prize of the International Critics (FIPRESCI Prize) for Special Presentation at the Toronto Film Festival, and will be distributed in France in 2009, and by IFC in the U.S. in 2010.

Dumont has a background of Greek and German (Western) philosophy, and of corporate video. His films often show the ugliness of extreme violence and provocative sexual behavior, and are usually classified as art films. Dumont has himself likened his films to visual arts, and he typically uses long takes, close-ups of people's bodies, and story lines involving extreme emotions. Dumont does not write traditional scripts for his films. Instead, he writes complete novels which are then the basis for his filmmaking.

He says that some of his favorite filmmakers are Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Roberto Rossellini, and Abbas Kiarostami. He is frequently considered an artistic heir to Robert Bresson.

His work has been associated with the New French Extremity. His film Outside Satan premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

John Fante (April 8, 1909 – May 8, 1983) was an Italian-American novelist, short story writer and screenwriter. He is best known for his semi-autobiographical novel Ask the Dust (1939) about the life of a struggling writer, Arturo Bandini, in Depression-era Los Angeles. It is widely considered the great Los Angeles novel and is one in a series of four novels, published between 1938 and 1985, that are now collectively called ""The Bandini Quartet"". Ask the Dust was adapted into a film made in 2006, starring Colin Farrell. In his lifetime, Fante published five novels, one novella, and a short story collection. Additional works, including two novels, two novellas, and two short story collections, were published posthumously. His screenwriting credits include, most notably, Full of Life (1956), based on his 1952 novel by that name, Jeanne Eagels (1957), and the 1962 films Walk on the Wild Side and The Reluctant Saint.",1909-04-08,1983-05-08,20306.0,Writing,"Denver, Colorado, USA",1.2217,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//oZ8ZzcrinAwYBrSaKsvJnhdKaL6.jpg

He is a member and founder of the group of comedians Les Nuls alongside Alain Chabat, Chantal Lauby and Bruno Carette.

Farrugia was born in Vichy, France, to a Jewish pied-noir and Maltese family.

Since the launching of Canal+, in 1984, he works in editing trailers and as a broadcast production assistant on the Tous en scène show. Thus he meets Canal+ first weatherman, Alain Chabat, with whom he would form the group of comedians Les Nuls alongside Chantal Lauby and Bruno Carette in 1986. In 1987 he is included in the writing of the TV series Objective: nul (7 d'Or for best comedy TV show), the first parody by Les Nuls. He hosts a parodic weather forecast in the 'JTN' of 'Nulle part ailleurs' from 1987 to 1988. Initially, he did not want to act, but rather write. The absence of one of the actors in an episode of Objective: nul accidentally placed him in front of the camera. TVN 595, a TV special which was broadcast in October 1988, won the 7 d'Or for best show. Les Nuls' career lasts until 1992.

In 1994, La Cité de la peur is released making 3,216,436 entries in the French box office.

After Les Nuls split, Dominique Farrugia starts a film career as a director with Delphine 1, Yvan 0 and Trafic d'influence. He subsequently becomes a producer founding the RF2K production company with the actor Olivier Granier.

In 1997 he founded the cable and satellite TV channel Comédie!, discovering new comic talents such as Les Robins des Bois, Franck Dubosc, Titoff, Kad & Olivier and Jonathan Lambert.

In April 2001, he created the cable and satellite TV channel Cuisine TV.

In 2001-2002, he produces Vidocq (1,865,998 entries in France) and Monsieur Batignole (1,872,045 entries in France).

In 2002, he first becomes director-general and deputy director of broadcasting and programming at Canal+ and later president from April 2002 to February 2003 and to date, only assistant becoming president of Canal+.

In July 2003, he created FEW (Farrudg Entertainment Worldwide), a media company producing feature films.

In 2007 he produced the show of Manu Payet, then two years later of Laurent Lafitte.

In 2009, he launched the website Les graves infos which presents false news. The site is closed on 23 February 2010.

In 2010, he co-directed with Arnaud Lemort the film L'amour c'est mieux à deux (1,250,000 entries in France, more profitable movie of 2010, with its particular stage of Clovis Cornillac, Virginia Efira and Manu Payet).

Between September 2010 and May 2011, he is a columnist in the show Tout le monde il est beau, tout le monde il est gentil, hosted by Bruce Toussaint, every Sunday on Canal+.

On 20 November 2012, FEW, his production company and Luc Besson's EuropaCorp, signed an agreement under which all FEW films will be produced exclusively in partnership with EuropaCorp.

He released studio albums, notably Baïda, Samra, Un Autre Soleil and Mundial Corrida and the live album 1,2,3 Soleils jointly with Khaled and Rachid Taha.

Born in Mantes-la-Jolie, a suburb of Paris, and raised by Algerian-born immigrant parents in the Val Fourré neighborhood, the young Faudel was introduced to Algerian raï by his grandmother who performed regularly in Oran with the meddahates, groups of female musicians who play traditional folk raï at weddings and other family occasions. It was Amaria, Faudel's grandmother, who was largely responsible for teaching him traditional raï rhythms during the summer holidays in Algeria.

His first public singing experience was during a family wedding celebration in Oran, Algeria. Faudel started to cover the popular tracks by Cheb Khaled and Cheb Mami at 12, after which he soon fronted the popular band Les Etoiles du Raï (The Rai Stars). Faudel and Les Etoiles du Rai soon became a well-known fixture at the youth club and other local associations in Mantes-la-Jolie. Faudel then went on to appear at clubs throughout the Paris suburbs, performing covers of Khaled, Zahouania and Mami's greatest hits, accompanied by a pre-recorded backing tape.

The turning-point of Faudel's early career came at the age of 13 when he was spotted at Printemps de Bourges by Mohamed Mestar (aka Momo). Mestar, an ex-guitarist, had recently set up an association in the suburbs to promote up-and-coming local artists and, after catching one of Faudel's concerts, he offered to take charge of the young Rai singer's career. Thanks to Momo's guiding hand, Faudel soon built up his own repertoire and began collaborating with different artists, and playing in a few Cheb Mami and MC Solaar concerts as well. Faudel went on to study accountancy and metallurgy, but his passion for Rai soon led to him taking up a professional singing career.

Faudel's debut album, Baïda, was released in 1997. A year later, he was invited to sing with Khaled and Rachid Taha in the 1, 2, 3 Soleils concert in Paris. His collaboration with them made him a household name in France and Algeria. His other albums include Samra and his album Un Autre Soleil (released Sept. 2003) and, most recently, Mundial Corrida (2006). He also has acted in a few roles, including Happenstance (Le Battement d'ailes du papillon) with Audrey Tautou.

Even though Faudel was still in his early teens, he managed to establish himself as the new voice of Rai. Indeed, in 1995 two French television documentaries were made about the rising young star from Mantes-la-Jolie - Saga cités (which was broadcast on the state-owned channel France 3) and Les Enfants du Rai (broadcast on the Franco-German channel Arte). The following year Faudel would be chosen to represent the Ile-de-France region at the prestigious Printemps de Bourges Festival. And the young singer's impressive performance in the New Talent category would only serve to increase his growing popularity. ...

Mohamed Fellag (ⴼⴻⵍⵍⴰⴳ in Tifinagh) was born in Azeffoun in Kabylia. He only spoke Kabyle until the family moved to Algiers when he was eight years old. He then learned Algerian Arabic and French.

His father, an FLN activist during the war, was killed in a car accident in 1965 during a mission (he was 15). He studied theater at the National Institute of Dramatic and Choreographic Art of Algiers, located in Bordj el Kiffan, from 1968 to 1972. He left the National Theater and founded his company with former students. They write texts, go on tour, play in prisons, factories, etc. He emigrated to Quebec in 1978, then to Paris in 1982, living from small jobs. In September 1985, he returned to Algeria and was hired by the Algerian National Theater to perform ""The Art of Comedy"" by Eduardo De Filippo. He worked as an actor and director, and began writing his texts, including his first show, ""Les Aventures de Tchop"" in 1986. He became a star thanks to performances mixing Berber, Arabic and French.

In 1991, ""Babor Australia"" was created in Kabyle, then performed in Algerian Arabic in Paris. At the Théâtre de l'Europe in 1992, it was performed alternately in Kabyle and Algerian Arabic. ""Babor Australia"", updated to ""A boat for Australia"" in 2002, is based on a rumor, evoking the imminent arrival in Algiers of an Australian boat supposed to take unemployed people to provide them with employment and accommodation there, which caused a queue in front of the Australian embassy.

He directed the Béjaïa theater for a while in 1992-939.

The Algerian Civil War broke out, Fellag went on tour in 1994 with ""Babor Australia"", in Algeria then in Tunisia. At the end of the year, he settled in Tunis where he created ""Delirium"". In 1995, he went into exile in Paris. He writes there ""Djurdjurassique Bled"", which is represented alternately in Kabyle and Algerian Arabic. Then, he adapted it into French and this first show in French, created in December 1997, earned him the 1997-1998 Critics' Union Prize, theatrical revelation of the year.

He was born in Milan and died in Paris of a myocardial infarction. Upon his death, Gilles Jacob, artistic director of the Cannes International Film Festival, said: The Italian cinema has lost one of its most original artists, one of its most personal authors (...) No one was more demanding nor more allegorical than he in showing the state of crisis of contemporary man. His best known film is La Grande Bouffe, starring Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli, Philippe Noiret and Ugo Tognazzi.

His 1979 film Chiedo asilo won him the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1991, his film La casa del sorriso won the Golden Bear at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival.

He worked also as an actor, cutter, sound engineer, interviewer and speaker. Fleischmann belonged to the New German Cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. He is known for directing the 1969 Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern (Hunting Scenes from Bavaria), but he produced films of many genres.

Peter Fleischmann was born in Zweibrücken. He studied at the Deutsches Institut für Film und Fernsehen (German Institute of Film and Television, DIFF) in Munich and Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC) in Paris. He had contact with representatives of the French Nouvelle Vague movement, and became a friend of Jean-Claude Carrière, with whom he later wrote screenplays. After years as an assistant director, he became a director in 1963 in short films and children's films. In 1967, he directed a documentary, Herbst der Gammler, about the Gammler subculture, which anticipated the gereration conflicts of the 1968 student movement.

His first full-length film was released in 1969, Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern, based on the play of the same name by Martin Sperr, who also played the leading role. The film reflects critically how a Bavarian village deals with outsiders, especially the homosexual character played by Sperr. The film was awarded prizes, including the Filmband in Silber of Deutscher Filmpreis. It was suggested for a nomination as the Oscars' best foreign film but was not nominated. The film made Fleischmann a representative of the New German Cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. The same year, Fleischmann and Volker Schlöndorff founded the film production company Hallelujah-Film.

In Fleischmann's later works, often the seemingly villainous character would turn out to be a good person. In Das Unheil (Havoc), with a script by Fleischmann and Martin Walser, he criticised in 1972 the provincial attitude of a Hessian small town and pollution of the environment. The film was awarded the Prix Luis Buñuel of the Cannes Festival. In Dorotheas Rache (1974), he created a provocative satire on the sexfilm wave. His 1979 film The Hamburg Syndrome (Die Hamburger Krankheit) about an unknown infectious plague in German, with actor Helmut Griem, received attention again in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. ...

Born in Boulogne-Billancourt in the department of Hauts-de-Seine in a family from Russian, Jewish Egyptian, German and Italian ancestry, Marina Foïs was discovered in 1986 for her comedy work in The School for Wives, at the age of 16. She decided to take classes by correspondence and obtained her high school final exam two years later. She then joined The Royal Imperial Green Rabbit Company, which later became Les Robins des Bois, composed of students from the Cours Florent taught by Isabelle Nanty.

The troupe caught the attention of Dominique Farrugia in 1996 and went on to act and direct in the Comédie+ show La Grosse Émission for two years. During that period, Foïs co-wrote sketches with Pierre-François Martin-Laval, playing a number of various characters, like the dim-witted Sophie Pétoncule and the pedantic director Marie-Mûre. The show continued the next year on Canal+ and had a bigger audience. In June 2001, Foïs and the troupe parted ways to focus on their individual film careers. Marina Foïs became a prolific actress, with two to five films released every year.

On 25 November 2020, it was announced that she will be the host for the 46th César Awards.

Marina Foïs has two sisters. Giulia Foïs is a journalist at Libération and a former columnist in the program Arrêt sur images presented by Daniel Schneidermann on France 5, and a current news anchor on I-Télé. Her second sister Elena is a doctor. Their brother, Fabio, died of an airplane crash while participating in an aerobatic demonstration.

Marina was in a partnership with fellow ""Robins des Bois"" actor Maurice Barthélémy. She also dated Maxime Lefrançois, Mister Univers 2010.

She started dating the director Éric Lartigau in 1999. On December 3, 2004, she gave birth to a boy, Lazare at the Hôpital Saint-Antoine in Paris. They had a second son, Georges, born on 25 September 2008.

Born Fontaine Sibertin-Blanc, sister of actor Jean-Chrétien Sibertin-Blanc, she went as a young child to live in Lisbon, where her father, Antoine Sibertin-Blanc, is a music professor and cathedral organist. In adolescence she moved to Paris and trained in dance with Joseph Russillo while continuing her academic education, including philosophy. Her husband is Philippe Carcassonne, the film producer, and they have an adopted son who was born in Vietnam.

While still dancing, she was picked by Robert Hossein to play Esmeralda in a 1980 theatrical production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and around this time started to use the name Anne Fontaine. She continued with acting and became known for her roles in comedies like Si ma gueule vous plaît... (1981) and P.R.O.F.S.(1985). An opportunity to be assistant director came with a 1986 stage version of Céline's Voyage au bout de la nuit (Journey to the End of the Night) at the Renaud-Barrault theatre.

Fontaine's first project as solo director, Les histoires d'amour finissent mal... en général (Love Affairs Usually End Badly), won the 1993 Prix Jean Vigo (prize). In 1995, she worked with her brother on the comic Augustin. Two years later, she wrote and directed the successful Nettoyage à Sec (Dry Cleaning). This won the Best Screenplay award at the Venice Film Festival 1997 and is generally considered a milestone on Fontaine's way to becoming ""an important figure in contemporary French cinema"".

In 1999 the character Augustin (Jean-Chrétien Sibertin-Blanc) re-appeared in Fontaine's film Augustin, Roi Du Kung-Fu (Augustin, King of Kung-Fu). Comment j'ai tué mon père (How I Killed My Father) was released in 2001, and Nathalie... followed in 2003. The 2005 film, Entre Ses Mains (In His Hands) has been widely described as a thriller: an ""intimate thriller"" according to Fontaine herself. A third Augustin film, Nouvelle chance (also known as Oh La La) was released in 2006. Then came La fille de Monaco (The Girl From Monaco) in 2008 and Coco avant Chanel (Coco Before Chanel), her biopic of Coco Chanel, in 2009.

Fontaine's work is not easily categorised, though the phrase ""psychological drama"" is often used. She told a UK newspaper, ""I try to work on my characters' blind side, in a kind of Freudian way: to ask, 'What are the things about themselves that they're unaware of?' I'm fascinated by the irony of fate, when something goes into a skid. All my stories have an element of cruelty in them.""

She has employed numerous unusual musical styles, melding rock and roll, folk, jazz, electronica, spoken word poetry, and world. She has collaborated with Stereolab, Michel Colombier, Jean-Claude Vannier, Areski Belkacem, Gotan Project, Sonic Youth, Antoine Duhamel, Grace Jones, Noir Désir, Archie Shepp, Arno, and The Art Ensemble of Chicago. She is also a novelist, playwright, poet, and actress.

The daughter of two teachers, Brigitte Fontaine developed her taste for writing and drama very early. She spent her childhood in small villages of Finistère, then in Morlaix. At 17 years old, she moved to Paris to become an actress.

In 1971, she was one of the women who signed the Manifesto of the 343, publicly admitting to having an abortion at a time when it was illegal in France.

In 1963, she turned to singing and appeared in several Parisian theatres, interpreting her own works. In 1964, she opened for Barbara and George Brassens's show at the Bobino. Even so, she did not give up theatre. With Jacques Higelin and actor Rufus, she created the play Maman j'ai peur (""Mom I am afraid""), which played first at the Vieille-Grille theatre, and then at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. It met with such a critical and popular success that it stayed in Paris for more than two seasons and toured throughout Europe.

In 1965 and then in 1968, she made two albums, one jazz and one avant-pop, as well as two 45s with Jacques Higelin. In 1969, she began what would be a long collaboration with Kabyle musician Areski Belkacem. With Belkacem and in the company of Higelin, she conceived Niok, an innovative spectacle of theatre and song, for the Lucernaire theatre. Soon after, Fontaine wrote a series of works in free verse and prose which comprised the show Comme à la radio at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier before being turned into an album of the same name. Recorded with the Art Ensemble of Chicago, this album marks a clean break with traditional French songs, building the first bridges to world music.

Brigitte Fontaine became a major figure in the French underground. In a half-dozen albums, the majority of which were released through the independent label Saravah, Fontaine explored different poetic worlds. She renounced the use of rhyme, and using talk-over sometimes, she recorded, with very little means and often on two tracks, songs which addressed topics with humour or gravity, according to the mood, as various as death (""Dommage que tu sois mort""), life (""L’été, l’été""), alienation (""Comme à la radio""), madness (""Ragilia""), love (""Je t’aimerai""), social injustice (""C’est normal""), the inequality of the sexes (""Patriarcat"") and racism (""Y' a du lard""). However, she also knew how to make light of herself (""L'Auberge (Révolution)""). ...

She was born Annie Violette Fratellini on 14 November 1932, in Algiers, French Algeria, where her parents, who were circus performers, were touring. She was the fourth generation of one of Europe's most illustrious clown dynasties, the Fratellini Family, a French circus family of Italian descent. Her father was Victor Fratellini, a clown and acrobat; her mother, Suzanne (née Rousseau), was the daughter of Gaston Rousseau, the director of the Cirque de Paris, a huge circus building located Avenue de la Motte-Picquet in Paris that was active from 1906 to 1930. Her grandfather was Paul Fratellini, one of the Fratellini brothers, the legendary clown trio that was the Toast of Paris (and Europe) between the two world wars.

Although she made her debut in the ring at age 13 at the famous Cirque Medrano in Paris, she eventually ran away from the circus when she was 18 years old, and begun a music-hall and recording career as a musician and singer. She also became a film actress, appearing notably in 1965 in La Métamorphose des cloportes a film directed by Pierre Granier-Deferre (1927–2007), whom she had married in 1954. They had one daughter, Valérie.

In 1969, she starred in Pierre Étaix's Le grand amour. They fell in love and married that same year. Pierre Étaix (1928–2016), who had been a comedian and Jacques Tati's assistant before becoming a filmmaker himself, had a passion for the circus and clowns. Annie Fratellini had an inherited talent for comedy, and Pierre Étaix convinced her to take it seriously. Together, they created a classic European clown duo in which Étaix was the Clown to Fratllini's Auguste (the comic character of the duet). They made their debut on tour with the French Cirque Pinder.

In 1975, Étaix and Fratellini opened the École Nationale du Cirque, one of Paris's (and Europe's) first two professional circus schools, and created the Nouveau Cirque de Paris, an intimate, high-end traveling circus that was the performing arm of the school, and in which they regularly performed their act. Pierre Étaix and Annie Fratellini divorced in 1987, and Annie continued to run the school and the circus, performing her clown act with her daughter, Valérie. The school has become the Académie Fratellini, one of France's two major state-sponsored circus schools.

Annie Fratellini died from cancer on 1 July 1997, at Neuilly-sur-Seine and is buried at the Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris, France, near the other members of her illustrious family.

Considered a key figure in French cinema, he starred in several classic films, including Pépé le Moko (1937), La grande illusion (1937), Le Quai des brumes (1938), La bête humaine (1938), Le jour se lève (1939), and Le plaisir (1952). During his career, he twice won the Silver Bear for Best Actor from the Berlin International Film Festival and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor from the Venice Film Festival, respectively. Gabin was made a member of the Légion d'honneur in recognition of the important role he played in French cinema.

Gabin was born Jean-Alexis Moncorgé in Paris, the son of Madeleine Petit and Ferdinand Moncorgé, a cafe owner and cabaret entertainer whose stage name was Gabin, which is a first name in French. He grew up in the village of Mériel in the Seine-et-Oise (now Val-d'Oise) département, about 22 mi (35 km) north of Paris. He attended the Lycée Janson de Sailly. Gabin left school early, and worked as a laborer until the age of 19 when he entered show business with a bit part in a Folies Bergère production. He continued performing in a variety of minor roles before going into the military.

After completing his military service in the Fusiliers marins, he returned to the entertainment business, working under the stage name of Jean Gabin at whatever was offered in the Parisian music halls and operettas, imitating the singing style of Maurice Chevalier, which was the rage at the time. He was part of a troupe that toured South America, and upon returning to France found work at the Moulin Rouge. His performances started getting noticed, and better stage roles came along that led to parts in two silent films in 1928.

Two years later Gabin made the transition to sound films in a 1930 Pathé Frères production, Chacun sa chance. Playing secondary roles, he made more than a dozen films over the next four years, including films directed by Maurice and Jacques Tourneur. But he only gained real recognition for his performance in Maria Chapdelaine, a 1934 production directed by Julien Duvivier. He was then cast as a romantic hero in the 1936 war drama La Bandera; this second Duvivier-directed film established him as a major star. The next year he teamed up with Duvivier again in the highly successful Pépé le Moko. Its popularity brought Gabin international recognition. That same year he starred in Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion, an antiwar film that ran at a New York City theatre for an unprecedented six months. This was followed by another of Renoir's major works, La Bête Humaine (The Human Beast), a film noir tragedy based on the novel by Émile Zola and starring Gabin and Simone Simon, as well as Le Quai Des Brumes (Port of Shadows), one of director Marcel Carné's classics of poetic realism.

He is the only author to have won the Prix Goncourt under two names. He is considered a major writer of French literature of the second half of the 20th century. He was married to Lesley Blanch, then Jean Seberg.

Gary was born Roman Kacew (Yiddish: רומן קצב‎ Roman Katsev, Russian: Рома́н Ле́йбович Ка́цев, Roman Leibovich Katsev) in Vilnius (at that time in the Russian Empire). In his books and interviews, he presented many different versions of his parents' origins, ancestry, occupation and his own childhood. His mother, Mina Owczyńska (1879—1941), was a Jewish actress from Švenčionys (Svintsyán) and his father was a businessman named Arieh-Leib Kacew (1883—1942) from Trakai (Trok), also a Lithuanian Jew. The couple broke in 1925 and Arieh-Leib remarried. Gary later claimed that his actual father was the celebrated actor and film star Ivan Mosjoukine, with whom his actress mother had worked and to whom he bore a striking resemblance. Mosjoukine appears in his memoir Promise at Dawn. Deported to central Russia in 1915, they stayed in Moscow until 1920. They later returned to Vilnius, then moved on to Warsaw. When Gary was fourteen, he and his mother emigrated illegally to Nice, France. Converted to Catholicism by his mother, Gary studied law, first in Aix-en-Provence and then in Paris. He learned to pilot an aircraft in the French Air Force in Salon-de-Provence and in Avord Air Base, near Bourges. ...

Gatlif struggled for years to break into the film industry, playing in several theatrical productions until directing his first film, La Tête en ruine, in 1975. He followed it with the 1979 La Terre au ventre, a story of the Algerian War of Independence.

Since the 1981 Corre, gitano, Gatlif's work has been focused on the Romani people of Europe, from whom he partially traces his descent.

After making Gaspard et Robinson in 1990, Gatlif spent 1992 and 1993 shooting Latcho Drom,  which was awarded numerous prizes. This feature-length musical film,  often mislabelled as a documentary, deals with gypsy culture throughout  the world around the theme of their music and dance. For Vincent Ostria,  then journalist at the Cahiers du Cinéma, it was ""the most genuine film  of the year (1993 editor's note)."" A year later, Gatlif brought the  world of the author J. M. G.

Gayet was born in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, where her father Brice Gayet is a professor and head of gastric surgery at the Institut Mutualiste Montsouris. He was former head of the clinic to the Lariboisière Hospital and lecturer at the Faculty Xavier Bichat at Paris Diderot University. Her mother is an antique dealer. Her paternal grandfather, Alain Gayet, was also a surgeon and became a Compagnon de la Libération after World War II. She received a social liberal intellectual upbringing.

Gayet studied art history and psychology at university, circus skills at the circus school of the Fratellini family, and operatic singing under Tosca Marmor. At the age of 17, she studied at the Actors Studio in London with Jack Waltzer, and then continued at the Tania Balachova School in Paris.

Gayet made her acting debut in a 1992 episode of the French TV series Premiers baisers, and had her first film role as an extra in Three Colors: Blue (1993), but her first role of public note was in the 1996 comedy Delphine 1, Yvan 0 by Dominique Farrugia.

Her musical performances include playing in video-clips for Benjamin Biolay and singing a duet with Marc Lavoine.

In 2007, she founded her own production company, Rouge International, with Nadia Turincev and produced films such as The Ride by Stephanie Gillard, Fix me by Palestinian Raed Andonia and Bonsai by Cristian Jimenez of Chile.

In 2013, Gayet co-directed with Mathieu Busson the documentary Cinéast(e)s featuring 20 French female film directors.

Gayet appeared on the cover of the 17 January 2014 issue of the French Elle magazine. The issue hit newsstands on 15 January 2014, two days ahead of its usual release day. The headline read ""Julie Gayet, Actress and Committed Woman, a French Passion"".

In 2003, Gayet married author and screenwriter Santiago Amigorena, but they divorced in 2006. The couple have two children.

Gayet is a centre-left activist, having appeared in a video supporting François Hollande during the 2012 French presidential election. She is a member of the Support Committee of the PS candidate for the 2014 Paris mayoral election, Anne Hidalgo. She also supported same-sex marriage in France.

In 2013 rumours started circulating that Gayet was in a secret relationship with President Hollande. On 10 January 2014, a story in the tabloid Closer featured seven pages of alleged revelations and photos about the affair, provoking wider media coverage. Hollande said he ""regretted this violation of his private life"" and was ""thinking about"" pursuing a legal response, but did not deny the substance of the story. The 10 January issue was so popular that Closer ""reprinted the issue, with a further 150,000 copies scheduled to hit newsstands"" on 15 January 2014. On 16 January 2014, the AFP news agency reported that Gayet would sue Closer for €50,000 in damages and €4,000 in legal costs. ...

A former collaborationist and criminal who at one time was sentenced to death, Giovanni often drew his inspiration from personal experience or from real gangsters, such as Abel Danos in his 1960 film Classe tous risques, overlooking that they had been members of the French Gestapo. In his films as well as his novels, while praising masculine friendships and advocating the confrontation of the individual against the world, he often championed the underworld but was always careful to hide his own links with the Nazi occupiers of France during World War II.

Of Corsican descent, Joseph Damiani received a good education, studying at the Collège Stanislas de Paris and the Lycée Janson de Sailly. His father, a professional gambler who was sentenced to a year in prison for running an illegal casino, owned a hotel in the French Alps in Chamonix. Joseph worked there as a young man and became fascinated by mountain climbing.

From April to September 1943 Damiani was a member of Jeunesse et Montagne (Youth and Mountain) in Chamonix, part of the Vichy Government youth movement controlled by Pierre Laval.

In February 1944 Damiani came to Paris and through his father's friend, the LVF leader Simon Sabiani, he joined Jacques Doriot's fascist French Popular Party (PPF). His maternal uncle, Ange Paul Santolini alias ""Santos"", who ran a restaurant patronized by the Gestapo, and his elder brother, Paul Damiani, a member of the Vichy paramilitary Milice, introduced Joseph into the Pigalle underworld.

In March 1944 Joseph Damiani went to Marseille where he became a member of the German Schutzkorps (SK), an organization which hunted down Service du travail obligatoire - STO (Compulsory Work Service) dodgers. He served as bodyguard to its Marseille chief and took part in many arrests, often blackmailing his victims.

In Lyon, in August 1944, posing as a German police officer along with an accomplice (Orloff, a Gestapo agent who was shot for treason at the Liberation), Damiani blackmailed Joseph Gourentzeig and his brother-in-law Georges Edberg, two Jews who were in hiding. Gourentzeig had bribed a member of the Milice - a friend of Damiani’s – in an attempt to secure his parents' release from a detention camp. They were not freed and Gourentzeig's father, Jacob, was shot by the Germans shortly after, on 21 August 1944, along with 109 Jewish hostages in the Bron (Lyon airport) massacre.

After the Liberation in Paris on 18 May 1945, Joseph Damiani, his brother Paul, Georges Accad, a former Gestapo agent, and Jacques Ménassole, a former member of the Milice wearing a French Army lieutenant's uniform - all posing as Military Intelligence officers - abducted Haïm Cohen, a wine merchant, accusing him of being a black marketeer. He was tortured until he gave them the key to his safe and a check for 105,000 francs. He was then shot and his body thrown into the Seine. Joseph Damiani cashed the check at Barclay's Bank under the identity of ""Count J. de Montreuil"". ...

In 2002, she was awarded the César Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in The Piano Teacher. She collaborated with director Michael Haneke again, in the 2005 film Caché.

Another of her best known roles was as Nadia the prostitute in Luchino Visconti's epic Rocco e i suoi fratelli (Rocco and His Brothers, 1960). Nadia's beauty drives a wedge between Rocco and his brother Simone (Renato Salvatori). In contrast to their violent on-camera relationship, Girardot and Salvatori married in 1962.

Claude Giraud studied with Tania Balachova at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier; Berthe Bovy and Jean Meyer at the École de la rue Blanche (École nationale supérieure des arts et techniques du théâtre, ENSATT). In November 1957 he was accepted as a student at CNSAD Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique, where he studied with Jean Debucourt and Fernand Ledoux. Upon his graduation he was the first male student to win all three categories during the Concourse (Classical Comedy, Modern Comedy, Tragedy). In 1962 he was the first recipient of the newly created Prix Gérard Philipe. He was engaged at the Comédie Française in 1962 as a pensionnaire. Besides his debut role as Valère in Molière's The Miser, he played Arsace in Corneille's Bérénice, and the narrator in the stage adaptation of André Gide's short story Le retour de l'enfant prodigue (The Return of the Prodigal Son). Disappointed that he was only cast in small roles, he left the Comédie Française after a few months to start his film career. He played the leading role as Capitaine Langlois in François Leterrier's movie adaptation of Jean Giono's novel A King Without Distraction in 1962. He was Oedipus in the film adaptation of Jean Cocteau's The Infernal Machine. He joined the Compagnie Marie Bell to play a US tour in New York City, Boston, Washington D.C., and Princeton in October–November 1963. For his presentation of Hippolite in Phèdre and Titus in Bérénice at The Brooks Atkinson Theatre on Broadway, he was awarded the Theater World Award. He played the role of the soldier Georges in Roger Vadim's Circle of Love, a film adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's scandalous play La Ronde (play). Between 1964 and 1966, Claude Giraud played the part of Philippe de Plessis-Bellières beside Michèle Mercier in three Angélique films: Angélique, Marquise des Anges, Marvelous Angelique, and Angelique and the King. He returned to the Comédie Française in 1972 and became the 460th sociétaire in 1976. He left again in 1982 to join Jean-Laurent Cochet's newly created Théâtre Hébertot.

He gained fame in TV series as hero Morgan/Jacques de Saint-Hermine in the adventure series Les Compagnons de Jéhu by Michel Drach adapted from the eponymous novel by Alexandre Dumas. Bernard Toublanc-Michel engaged him in 1967 for the role of d'Aulnay in Adolphe ou l'âge tendre. The TV series Les rois maudits, where he played the role of Sir Roger Mortimer, was another huge success. In 1973, he played the fictional Arab revolutionary leader Mohamed Larbi Slimane, who poses as Rabbi Zeiligman in The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob with Louis de Funès. In the TV movie Mamie Rose (1976) he played Claude Jade's husband Régis, whose marriage is saved by an au-pair granny played by Gisèle Casadesus.

Other TV series include Mathias Sandorf (1979), in which he played corrupt banker Silas Toronthal, based on Jules Verne's eponymous novel.

He married Catherine Marquand (1943-2012), a fellow acting student at the Conservatoire, in 1963. They had a son, Louis (*1963), and a daughter, Marianne (*1966), who is also an actress and married to French actor and director Jean Martinez. ...

He performed with the world's top orchestras, including the London Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, and Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.

Yitzhak-Meir (Isaac) Gitlis was born on 25 August 1922 in Haifa, Israel to Jewish parents, who emigrated in 1921 from Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukraine.

Gitlis acquired his first violin when he was five years old and started lessons under Mme Velikovsky together with his friend Zvi Zeitlin. He then studied privately with Mira Ben-Ami, a pupil of Joseph Szigeti. When he was eight, she arranged for him to play for Bronisław Huberman, which prompted a fundraising campaign to allow him to study in France.

In 1933, he arrived with his mother in Paris and started to take lessons with Marcel Chailley, husband of the pianist Céliny Chailley-Richez. Being very close to their family, he was introduced to George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud. In that period, he decided to change his birth name (Isaac) to Ivry. At 11, Gitlis (Jitlis) entered the Conservatoire de Paris in the class of Jules Boucherit, and graduated in 1935.

In 1938–1940, his teachers included George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud in Paris and Carl Flesch in Spa, Belgium and later in London.

In 1940, during World War II, he went to London where he first worked for two years in a war factory and was then assigned to the artists branch of the British Army. He gave numerous concerts for the Allied soldiers and in war factories. After the war he made his successful debut with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and subsequently played with the BBC and all other principal orchestras of Great Britain.

In 1951, as suggested by his teacher Alice Pashkus, he participated in the Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris, where he took fifth place. During the preliminary stages of the competition, a rumor circulated that he had stolen a Stradivarius violin during the war, which caused a scandal on the day of the final. Six years after the fall of Hitler, being a Jew in France was still causing debate. In the same year, Gitlis made his debut in Paris, playing in a recital at the Salle Gaveau, sponsored by the music manager Marcel de Valmalète (9 July 1951).

In the 1950s, he moved to the United States where he met Jascha Heifetz. There he made several tours, managed by Sol Hurok, including those conducted by Eugene Ormandy (Tchaikovsky, in Philadelphia) and George Szell (Sibelius, on 15,16 and 18 December 1955 in New York). Back in Europe, between 1954 and 1955, he recorded for the Vox label concertos by Berg (Violin Concerto ""To the memory of an angel"", coupled with ""Chamber Concerto"" -Vox PL 8660- which was awarded a ""Grand Prix du Disque"" in 1954), Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Stravinsky (Violin Concerto, coupled with ""Duo Concertant"") and with the conductor Jascha Horenstein, Bartók, Bruch and Sibelius. His recording of Bartók's 2nd Violin Concerto and Solo Violin Sonata -Vox PL 9020- received the ""Best Record of the Year"" award from the New York Herald Tribune in 1955. ...

She started working in the film industry in 1915 in the silent film En famille, an adaptation of the novel by Hector Malot, before dedicating herself to theatre. She went back to working in films, now talkies, in the 1930s. She came to fame in the 1940s with films such as Monsieur Hector (1940), Boléro (1942) or Devil in the Flesh (1947). Old age did not put an end to her career. For example, in 1972, she starred in a French television series called Les Rois maudits. Thanks to the film La Boum, in which she plays ""Poupette"", the great-grandmother of Sophie Marceau, she gained recognition from a new audience growing up in the 1980s.

She was a member of the Comédie-Française between 1944 and 1946 and between 1957 and 1958.

She had a daughter: Suzanne Grey, also an actress, who was born on 28 June 1917 and died on 13 December 2005.

In 1986, she sang Devenir vieux (Becoming Old). She died in 1996, a few months before reaching the age of 100.

Her best known songs are ""Paris Canaille"" (1962, originally sung by Léo Ferré), ""La Javanaise"" (1963, written by Serge Gainsbourg for Gréco) and ""Déshabillez-moi"" (1967). She often sang tracks with lyrics written by French poets such as Jacques Prévert and Boris Vian, as well as singers like Jacques Brel and Charles Aznavour. Her 60-year career came to an end in 2015 when she began her last worldwide tour titled ""Merci"".

As an actress, Gréco played roles in films by French directors such as Jean Cocteau and Jean-Pierre Melville.

Juliette Gréco was born in Montpellier, France, to an absent Corsican father, Gérard Gréco; her mother Juliette Lafeychine (1899–1978) was from Bordeaux. Her lineage hails in part from Greece. She did not receive love from her mother in her childhood and suffered from her harsh comments due to being an unwanted child, such as ""You ain't my daughter. You're the child of rape"". She was raised by her maternal grandparents in Bordeaux with her older sister Charlotte. After the death of her grandparents, her mother took them to Paris. In 1938, she became a ballerina at the Opéra Garnier.

When World War II began, the family returned to the southwest of France. Gréco was a student at the Institut Royal d'éducation Sainte Jeanne d'Arc in Montauban. The Gréco family became active in the Resistance and her mother was arrested in 1943. The two sisters decided to move back to Paris but were captured and tortured by the Gestapo, then imprisoned in Fresnes Prison in September 1943. Her mother and sister were deported to Ravensbrück while Juliette, being only 16, remained in prison for several months before being released. After her release, she walked the eight miles back to Paris to retrieve her belongings from the Gestapo headquarters. Her former French teacher and her mother's friend, Hélène Duc, decided to take care of her.

In 1945, Gréco's mother and sister returned from deportation after the liberation of Ravensbrück by the Red Army. Gréco moved to Saint-Germain-des-Prés in 1945 after her mother moved to Indochina, leaving Gréco and her sister behind.

Gréco became a devotee of the bohemian fashion of some intellectuals of post-war France. Duc sent her to attend acting classes given by Solange Sicard. She made her debut in the play Victor ou les Enfants au pouvoir in November 1946 and began to host a radio show dedicated to poetry.

Her friend Jean-Paul Sartre installed her at the Hotel La Louisiane and commented that Greco had ""millions of poems in her voice"". She was known to many of the writers and artists working in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, such as Albert Camus, Jacques Prévert and Boris Vian, thus gaining the nickname la Muse de l'existentialisme.

Gréco spent the post-Liberation years frequenting the Saint-Germain-des-Prés cafes, immersing herself in political and philosophical bohemian culture. As a regular at music and poetry venues like Le Tabou on Rue Dauphine, she was acquainted with Jean Cocteau, and was given a role in Cocteau's film Orphée (1950). ...

He was the son of a leading French actor, Lucien Guitry, and followed his father into the theatrical profession. He became known for his stage performances, particularly in boulevardier roles. He was also a prolific playwright, writing 115 plays throughout his career. He was married five times, always to rising actresses whose careers he furthered. Probably his best-known wife was Yvonne Printemps to whom he was married between 1919 and 1932.

Guitry's plays range from historical dramas to contemporary light comedies. Some have musical scores, by composers including André Messager and Reynaldo Hahn. When silent films became popular Guitry avoided them, finding the lack of spoken dialogue fatal to dramatic impact. From the 1930s to the end of his life he enthusiastically embraced the cinema, making as many as five films in a single year.

The later years of Guitry's career were overshadowed by accusations of collaborating with the occupying Germans after the capitulation of France in the Second World War. The charges were dismissed, but Guitry, a strongly patriotic man, was disillusioned by the vilification he received from some of his compatriots. By the time of his death, his popular esteem had been restored to the extent that 12,000 people filed past his coffin before his burial in Paris.

Guitry was born at No 12 Nevsky Prospect, Saint Petersburg, Russia, the third son of the French actors Lucien Guitry and his wife Marie-Louise-Renée née Delmas de Pont-Jest (1858–1902). The couple had eloped, in the face of family disapproval, and were married at St Martin in the Fields, London, in 1882. They then moved to the then Russian capital, where Lucien ran the French theatre company, the Théâtre Michel, from 1882 to 1891. The marriage was brief. Guitry senior was a persistent adulterer, and his wife instituted divorce proceedings in 1888. Two of their sons died in infancy (one in 1883 and the other in 1887); the other surviving son, Jean (1884–1920) became an actor and journalist. The family's Russian nurse habitually shortened Alexandre-Pierre's name to the Russian diminutive ""Sacha"", by which he was known all his life. The young Sacha made his stage debut in his father's company at the age of five.

Lucien Guitry, considered the most distinguished actor in France since Coquelin, was immensely successful, both critically and commercially. When he returned to Paris he lived in a flat in a prestigious spot, overlooking the Place Vendôme and the Rue de la Paix. The young Sacha lived there, and for his schooling he was first sent to the well-known Lycée Janson de Sailly in the fashionable Sixteenth arrondissement. He did not stay long there, and went to a succession of other schools, both secular and religious, before abandoning formal education at the age of sixteen. ...

Isabelle Gélinas was born in Montreal, Quebec. She began her training course at the Cours Florent before joining the CNSAD where she took classes with teachers such as Pierre Vial, Daniel Mesguich and especially Michel Bouquet. Her beginnings in the occupation were not without difficulties, and she was often qualified as ""too young"", ""too mature"" and even ""not modern enough"". She had a hard time finding her place in the acting field. She began her career (1982–86) in the theater, playing in several dramas of Molière with Jean Davy as the director.

In 1986, her participation in the short film Triple sec with Suzanne Flon and André Dussollier gave her the opportunity to begin a film career. She had a real change in 1988 when she was featured in the comedy film Suivez cet avion (1989) with Lambert Wilson and in the drama film Chouans! (2009) with Philippe Noiret. She also began at the same time a television career featuring in several films mostly directed by Caroline Huppert. She then played in the drama films Mado poste restante (1989), Louis, the Child King (1992), Drôles d'oiseaux (1993), and in the comedy films À l'heure où les grands fauves vont boire (1993) and Regarde-moi quand je te quitte (1993). At the second part of the decade, she featured in two successful films playing supporting roles: Didier (1997) with Jean-Pierre Bacri and Alain Chabat, and Paparazzi (1998) with Vincent Lindon and Patrick Timsit. She played in television films of different fields such as Moi, Général de Gaulle (1990), J'ai deux amours (1996) and Chaos technique (1997).

The following decade, she played in a few comedy films such as Les gens en maillot de bain ne sont pas (forcément) superficiels (2001), Ne quittez pas (2003), Cherche fiancé tous frais payés (2005) and Ça se soigne? (2008). She has focused her career on television and theater, including many television fictions like Le Piège du Père Noël (2005), the trilogy of Inséparables (2005–06) with Michel Boujenah, but also Frappes interdites (2005) and Passés troubles (2006). She plays since 2007 one of the main roles in the comedy series Fais pas ci, fais pas ça.

Estelle Lefébure ([ɛstɛl ləfebyʁ]; born 11 May 1966) is a French actress and model. She was one of the top fashion models in the 1980s and 1990s. Estelle Lefebure, as she was known in the early 1980s, was discovered by George Gallier and managed by him exclusively at Prestige Models in Paris, France. George Gallier then moved to New York City to start American Model Management, and managed her career until 1991. Her national recognition was immediate after the first Guess (clothing) campaign shot by Wayne Mazer in the early 1980s; she then shot several covers of American Vogue with photographer Richard Avedon, several covers of American Elle with Marc Hispard, Gilles Ben Simon and Bill King. French Elle magazine model editor Odile Saron was also instrumental in helping Estelle's career take off.

Born in Cheltenham in 1925, he studied at Oxford University and, in 1949, he joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon. Television viewers most fondly remember him as the overbearing Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small (1978) but his most critically acclaimed performance was as the title character of Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981). His portrayal of Britain's wartime leader was so accurately observed that, in the following years, he was called on to reprise the role in such productions as The Woman He Loved (1988) and War and Remembrance (1988).

Unlike some British character actors, Hardy was not a Hollywood name and his work in films was therefore restricted to appearances in predominantly British-based productions such as The Spy Who Came In from the Cold (1965), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) and Sense and Sensibility (1995). However, in the 21st century, Hardy came to the attention of a whole new generation for his performances in the hugely successful Harry Potter films, while also continuing to make regular appearances in British television series. His co-star from All Creatures Great and Small (1978), Peter Davison, quite simply described Hardy as an ""extraordinary"" actor who would ""never do the same thing twice"" when he was acting with him. He was awarded the CBE for services to acting.

His 2011 film The Artist competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival but lost to The Tree of Life. Dujardin though won the best actor prize at Cannes for his role in The Artist.

Hazanavicius was born in Paris. His family is Jewish, and originally from Lithuania. His grandparents were from both Poland and Lithuania and settled in France in the 1920s. Before directing films, Hazanavicius worked in television, beginning with the Canal+ channel, where he started as a director in 1988. He began directing commercials for companies such as Reebok and Bouygues Telecom, and then, in 1993, he made his first feature-length film, La Classe américaine, for television. The film, co-directed with Dominique Mézerette, consisted entirely of footage taken from various films produced by the Warner Bros. studio, re-edited and dubbed into French. In 1997, Hazanavicius directed his first short film, Echec au capital, and followed it up with his first theatrically released feature, Mes amis, which starred his brother, actor Serge Hazanavicius.

Seven years later, Hazanavicius wrote and directed his second feature, OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies, a parody of 1960s spy movies and specifically of OSS 117, a popular character created by Jean Bruce in 1949. The $17.5 million film was a modest box office success, with $23 million worldwide receipts. A sequel, OSS 117: Lost in Rio, followed in 2009. Both films were later distributed in the United States by Music Box Films. The Artist, a black and white film without dialogue which takes place in Hollywood on the eve of sound film, screened in competition at the 2011 Cannes International Film Festival. The Artist was later released to universal acclaim. On 24 January 2012 Hazanavicius received nominations for three Oscars: the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. Hazanavicius said winning an Oscar would be ""like dreaming of going to the moon – you don't really believe it could ever happen."" Hazanavicius won the Academy Award for Best Director for The Artist, at the 84th Academy Awards. He was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2012 along with 175 other individuals.

He contributed a section to the omnibus film The Players (Les Infidèles) starring Jean Dujardin. He then announced that his next feature film would be a remake of the 1948 Fred Zinnemann film The Search. The film stars Berenice Bejo in the Montgomery Clift role as an NGO worker helping a little boy find his family in modern-day Chechnya and was produced by Thomas Langmann. Golden Globe Award actress winner Annette Bening also stars in the film.

Hazanavicius was in a relationship with film director Virginia Lovisone, and they have two daughters together, Simone and Fantine. He is married to Bérénice Bejo, who acted in his films OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies, The Artist and The Search.

With Delicatessen (1991) by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, Ticky Holgado saw his acting talent acknowledged. Gérard Jugnot wrote for him the character of the beggar who meets the frame in the unemployment becoming NFA (played by Jugnot) in Une époque formidable (1990).

He received the Caesar of the best male bit part in 1992 for Une époque formidable and in 1996 for Gazon maudit.

In September 2003, Holgado announced the remission of his lung cancer, which had considerably rarefied his appearances on the screen since 2000. On 5 January 2004, he had just begun work on a new film with Lelouch, but he succumbed to cancer on 22 January 2004. He left a posthumous message, in the form of a document which appeared on his hospital bed after taking him to surgery to remove his 4th cancerous tumor. Holgado declared there: ""It is necessary to tell to people that it's absolutely necessary to stop smoking"".

Ticky Holgado was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery (45th division).

Honoré was born in Carhaix, Finistère. After moving to Paris in 1995, he wrote articles in Les Cahiers du Cinéma. He started writing soon after. His 1996 book Tout contre Léo (Close to Leo) talks about HIV and is aimed at young adults; he made it into a film in 2002. He wrote other books for young adults throughout the late 1990s. His first play, Les Débutantes, was performed at Avignon's Off Festival in 1998. In 2005, he returned to Avignon to present Dionysos impuissant in the ""In"" Festival, with Joana Preiss and Louis Garrel playing the leads.

A well-known director, he is considered an ""auteur"" in French cinema. His 2006 film Dans Paris has led him to be considered by French critics as the heir to the Nouvelle Vague cinema. In 2007, Les Chansons d'amour was one of the films selected to be in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Honoré is openly gay, and some of his movies or screenplays (among them Les Filles ne savent pas nager, Dix-sept fois Cécile Cassard and Les Chansons d'amour) deal with gay or lesbian relations. His film Plaire, aimer et courir vite (Sorry Angel), about a writer who has contracted HIV in the 1990s, won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in 2018. Honoré has been the screenwriter for some of Gaël Morel's films. The actors Louis Garrel and Chiara Mastroianni have each had roles in several of his films.

Honoré has also directed several operas for the stage. For the Opéra de Lyon he directed Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites in 2013, Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande in 2015, and Verdi's Don Carlos in 2018. He also presented his production of Mozart's Così fan tutte at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the Edinburgh Festival in 2016, and Puccini's Tosca at Aix-en-Provence in 2019; both of these productions adopted a radical approach to traditional works.

In the summer of 2020 Honoré's rehearsals of his stage production of Le Côté de Guermantes, based on the third volume of Proust's In Search of Lost Time, were interrupted by restrictions to combat the COVID-19 epidemic and it became impossible to present it at the Comédie-Française as planned. With his troupe of actors he decided to make a film about the production and the uncertainties they were now facing, and the film Guermantes was released in September 2021.",1970-04-10,,76910.0,Directing,"Carhaix, Brittany, France",1.5386,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//vhRdx5xeSjlB6lPfXsnc0L3g02g.jpg

He directed the 1982 adaption of Les Misérables, and appeared in Vice and Virtue, Le Casse, Les Uns et les Autres and Venus Beauty Institute. His most recent roles include starring as Michèle Mercier's husband in the Angélique series and as a Catholic priest who falls in love with Claude Jade and becomes a communist in Prêtres interdits (Forbidden Priests) in 1973.

Hossein started directing films in 1956 with Les salauds vont en enfer from a story by Frédéric Dard whose novels and plays went on to furnish Hossein with much of his later film material. Right from the start Hossein established his characteristic trademarks: using a seemingly straightforward suspense plot and subverting its conventions (sometimes to the extent of a complete disregard of the traditional demand for a final twist or revelation) in order to concentrate on ritualistic relationships. This is the director's running preoccupation which is always stressed in his films by an extraordinary command of film space and often striking frame compositions where the geometry of human figures and set design is used to accentuate the psychological set-up of the scene. The mechanisms of guilt and the way it destroys relationships is another recurring theme, presumably influenced by Hossein's lifelong interest in the works of Dostoyevski.

Although Hossein had some modest international successes with films like Toi, le venin and Le vampire de Dusseldorf, he was much singled out for scorching criticism by the critics and followers of the New Wave for the unashamedly melodramatic frameworks of his films. The fact that he was essentially an auteur director with a consistent set of themes and an extraordinary mastery of original and unusual approaches to staging his stories, was never appreciated. He was not averse to trying his hand at widely different genres and was never defeated, making the strikingly different spaghetti western Une corde, un Colt and the low-budgeted but daringly subversive period drama J'ai tué Raspoutine. However, because of the lack of wider success and continuing adverse criticism, Hossein virtually ended his film directing career in 1970, having concentrated on theatre where his achievements were never questioned, and subsequently returning to film directing only twice. With two or three exceptions, his films remain commercially unavailable and very difficult to see.

He is the son of André Hossein a Zoroastrian French composer of Azerbaijani-Tajik descent, and a Jewish comedy actress from Kiev. He was married three times: first to Marina Vlady (he has two sons with her, Pierre and Igor), later to Caroline Eliacheff (with whom he has a son, Nicholas). He is currently married to actress Candice Patou, with whom he has one son, Julien.

According to an article written by Emannuel Peze, Hossein experienced a conversion to Catholicism in 1971 during a visit to the Marian apparition at San Damiano in Lombardo Italy.

nm0402161,André Hunebelle,1896.0,1985.0,"director,producer,writer","tt0052644,tt0141673,tt0059206,tt0053696","André Hunebelle (1 September 1896 – 27 November 1985) was a French maître verrier (master glassmaker) and film director.

After attending polytechnic school for mathematics, he became a decorator, a designer, and then a master glass maker in the mid-1920s (first recorded exhibition PARIS 1927 included piece ""Fruit & Foliage""). His work is known for its clean lines, which are elegant and singularly strong. He exhibited his own glass in a luxurious store located at 2 Avenue Victor-Emmanuel III, at the roundabout of the Champs Èlysées in Paris. Etienne Franckhauser, who also made molds for Lalique and Sabino, made the molds for Hunebelle's glass which was fabricated by the crystal factory in Choisy-le-Roi, France. Hunebelle's store ceased all activity in 1938 prior to World War II.

Hunebelle pieces are marked in several ways. The most common is A.HUNEBELLE-FRANCE in molded capitals either within the glass design or on the base. Other pieces are marked simply A.HUNEBELLE. There was also a paper label with A and H superimposed in a stylized manner. Since paper labels are frequently lost, many pieces may appear completely unmarked. In the author's collection there are pieces marked A.HUNEBELLE both with and without the word FRANCE, and a bowl marked MADE IN FRANCE that is identical to one shown in a Hunebelle catalogue. Hunebelle also used a more elaborate maker's mark imprinted on some glass pieces which had the word FRANCE encircled by the words MADE IN FRANCE MODELLE DEPOSE et R COGNEVILLE and with A. HUNEBELLE underneath (reflects mid 1930s partnership with COGNEVILLE).

In a short essay, he defined his stylistic aims as a glassmaker, explaining that he wanted to be ""an adept of an abstract art where the geometric exactness, the poetry of line, and transparency are combined.""

He also patented techniques for producing exact mouldings of items.

His glasswork displays a calculated modernism in contrast to influences derived from animals, plants and flowers which featured in the work of contemporaries such as René Lalique, Pierre D'Avesn and Marius-Ernest Sabino at the time. Hunebelle chose to focus on geometric forms, using technique and his scientific background to enhance light emission as much as possible. Surface contrasts, volume intersections, polished-non polished effects, geometry, light and poetry of line feature prominently in his work. Hunebelle employed both mold-blown and pressed-molded techniques in producing his pieces.

Hunebelle was a publisher of a French newspaper called La Fleché. During World War II, he had no job until a friend Marcel Achard found him work in films for Production Artistique Cinématographique (P.A.C.) where he acted as an art director and later began producing films beginning with Leçon de conduite (1946). He directed his first film Métier de fous in 1948.

His next three films were a film series of French film noir featuring Raymond Rouleau as a journalist character mixing with crime. All three had the titles beginning with the letter ""M"" in honour of author Pierre Benoît whose heroines all began with the letter ""A"". The films were written by Michel Audiard, a crime novelist. ...

His strong facial features made him a favourite villain of French cinema for exotic adventure films and crime movies.

Inkijinoff was born to a Christian Buryat father and a Russian mother in Irkutsk gubernia.

He studied at the Polytechnical Institute of Saint Petersburg and was for a time one of the resident actors of an imperial theater of this city. At the beginning of his career in Russia, he appeared first as stuntman in a few movies and then as director and as actor. His major lead role during the Russian part of his career is The Son in Storm Over Asia by Vsevolod Pudovkin in 1928, a major Soviet propaganda film about a fictional British consolidation of Mongolia.

He was also an actor in the troop of Vsevolod Meyerhold and was then appointed as director of the movie and theater school of Kiev in Ukraine.

In 1930, while in France on a European tour, he refused to return to the USSR. According to Boris Shumyatsky, after Stalin learned Inkijinoff had never returned in 1934, said: ""Too bad that the man escaped. Now he, probably, is dying to come back but, alas, too late."" He starred in 2 movies while living in the Soviet Union, and contrary to Stalin's assumption, Inkijinoff became immensely popular in Europe, arguably the most successful Soviet actor abroad, starring in a total of 44 French, British, German, and Italian films.

In France he frequently played the part of Asian villains. His most active period was in the thirties, when he appeared in Les Bateliers de la Volga and the G. W. Pabst film Le drame de Shanghai. He played for Fritz Lang in 1959, in Der Tiger von Eschnapur and its sequel Das indische Grabmal, in which he played the role of the high priest Yama. In 1965, Philippe de Broca cast him as Monsieur Goh, the wise but scary Chinese who guarantees to the Jean-Paul Belmondo character a certain death in Les tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine.

His last movie was with Brigitte Bardot and Claudia Cardinale, where he played the role of Indian chief Spitting Bull in Les pétroleuses.

He was a great friend of Charles Dullin and Louis Jouvet, and had a long career in French theater, appearing for instance in Marie Galante by Jacques Deval.

He died at his home in Brunoy, Essonne, France, aged 78.

nm0409560,Eugène Ionesco,1909.0,1994.0,"writer,actor,director","tt1691826,tt7842508,tt0070605,tt0056467","Eugène Ionesco (born Eugen Ionescu, 26 November 1909 – 28 March 1994) was a Romanian-French playwright who wrote mostly in French, and was one of the foremost figures of the French avant-garde theatre in the 20th century. Ionesco instigated a revolution in ideas and techniques of drama, beginning with his ""anti play"", The Bald Soprano which contributed to the beginnings of what is known as the Theatre of the Absurd, which includes a number of plays that, following the ideas of the philosopher Albert Camus, explore concepts of absurdism. He was made a member of the Académie française in 1970, and was awarded the 1970 Austrian State Prize for European Literature, and the 1973 Jerusalem Prize.

Ionesco was born in Slatina, Romania, to a Romanian father belonging to the Orthodox Christian church and a mother of French and Romanian heritage, whose faith was Protestant (the faith into which her father was born and to which her originally Greek Orthodox Christian mother had converted). Eugène was baptized into the Orthodox Christian faith. Many sources cite his birthdate as 1912, this error being due to vanity on the part of Ionesco himself, who wanted the year of his birth to coincide with that of when his idol, Romanian playwright Caragiale, died.

He spent most of his childhood in France and, while there, had an experience he claimed affected his perception of the world more significantly than any other. As Deborah B. Gaensbauer describes in Eugène Ionesco Revisited, ""Walking in summer sunshine in a white-washed provincial village under an intense blue sky, [Ionesco] was profoundly altered by the light."" He was struck very suddenly with a feeling of intense luminosity, the feeling of floating off the ground and an overwhelming feeling of well-being. When he ""floated"" back to the ground and the ""light"" left him, he saw that the real world in comparison was full of decay, corruption and meaningless repetitive action. This also coincided with the revelation that death takes everyone in the end. Much of his later work, reflecting this new perception, demonstrates a disgust for the tangible world, a distrust of communication, and the subtle sense that a better world lies just beyond our reach. Echoes of this experience can also be seen in references and themes in many of his important works: characters pining for an unattainable ""city of lights"" (The Killer, The Chairs) or perceiving a world beyond (A Stroll in the Air); characters granted the ability to fly (A Stroll in the Air, Amédée, Victims of Duty); the banality of the world which often leads to depression (the Bérenger character); ecstatic revelations of beauty within a pessimistic framework (Amédée, The Chairs, the Bérenger character); and the inevitability of death (Exit the King).

He returned to Romania with his father and mother in 1925 after his parents divorced. There he attended Saint Sava National College, after which he studied French Literature at the University of Bucharest from 1928 to 1933 and qualified as a teacher of French. While there he met Emil Cioran and Mircea Eliade, and the three became lifelong friends. ...

Jaoui has won six César Awards, three Lumières Awards, and a Best Screenplay Award at the Cannes Film Festival. She has received numerous other awards and nominations, including a nomination for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

Jaoui was born in Antony, Hauts-de-Seine, and is of Tunisian Jewish descent. She is the daughter of Hubert Jaoui and Gyza Jaoui, who are both writers. They moved to Paris when she was 8 years old. She started theatre when she was in high school at the Lycée Henri-IV in Paris. She entered the Cours Florent when she was 15. Patrice Chéreau, director of the Théâtre des Amandiers in Nanterre where she began attending drama classes in 1984, gave her a role in the film Hôtel de France in 1987. That same year, she appeared in Harold Pinter's L'anniversaire with Jean-Pierre Bacri, who later became a faithful colleague and companion.

Jaoui and Bacri wrote the play Cuisine et dépendances, which was adapted onscreen in 1992 by Philippe Muyl. In 1993, director Alain Resnais asked them to write an adaptation of Alan Ayckbourn's 8-part play Intimate Exchanges, which became the 2-part film Smoking/No Smoking. This ironic diptych about free will and destiny won the César Award for Best Writing in 1994. In 1996, they came to know greater success with Cédric Klapisch's adaptation of their play Family Resemblances (Un air de famille), which showed their ability to observe and depict everyday life, and to criticize the social norms through bitter and corrosive humor. Once again, they won the César Award for Best Writing in 1997 and the same year collaborated again with Resnais on Same Old Song (On connaît la chanson), which they wrote but also interpreted: together, they won their third César Award for Best Writing, and Jaoui her first César Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Jaoui directed her first feature film, The Taste of Others (Le Goût des autres, 2000, written with Bacri), which questions social-cultural identities. The film was a huge success in France and attracted 4 million spectators. It also won 4 César Awards in 2001 including Best Film and Best Writing, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2004, Jaoui's second film as a director, Look at Me (Comme une image), co-written with Bacri, was selected for the Cannes Festival and won the prize for Best Screenplay. She starred in the last Richard Dembo's film, La maison de Nina (2005) and then focused on music and released her album of Latin songs, Canta (2006). She returned to cinema in 2008 with Let's Talk About the Rain (Parlez-moi de la pluie), with French humorist Jamel Debbouze in a different role from what he was used to.

In 2012, Jaoui directed her latest film to date, Under the Rainbow (Au bout du conte), also co-written with Bacri. She revisits several fairy tales such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Little Red Riding Hood. It received acclaim from critics and audiences for originality and humor in the writing and dialogue. ...

Although his father's name was Henri, Francis Jeanson was not related to the Henri Jeanson who was a journalist at Le Canard enchaîné, Le Crapouillot, and a screenwriter.

During the Second World War, he escaped through Spain to flee the Service du travail obligatoire and joined the Armée française de la Libération in 1943.

A reporter for the Alger républicain in 1945, he met Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre and the latter entrusted to him the management of the magazine Les Temps modernes from 1951 to 1956. He wrote the critique of The Rebel, which eventually led to ending for good the relationship between Sartre and Camus.

He became acquainted with Emmanuel Mounier, who in 1948 opened for him the doors of the magazine Esprit, where there was a certain 'philocommunism' and who facilitated his entry into the intellectual seraglio of the post-war period. Mounier also invited him to the reading committee of the Éditions du Seuil and recommended him to its literary director, Paul Flamand. At the death of Mounier in March 1950, Jeanson took over the direction of the series ""Écrivains de Toujours"".

Beginning in 1957, at the height of the Algerian war, he put his anti-colonial ideals into practice by creating the Jeanson network to transport funds to the National Liberation Front of Algeria. This clandestine network of militants was disbanded in 1960. Fleeing abroad, Francis Jeanson was tried in absentia, convicted of high treason, and sentenced in October 1960 to ten years' imprisonment.

He returned to Paris on the occasion of his amnesty in 1966, then worked with the Théâtre de Bourgogne (directed by Jacques Fornier) and was in charge of prefiguring the cultural policy of the Maison de la culture in Chalon-sur-Saône (1967–1971). He proposed and elaborated through this experience the notion of ""non-public"", which will be resumed in May 1968 in the Declaration of Villeurbanne, of which he was the main editor.

Solicited by psychiatrists, he then led interventions for an open psychiatry, a psychiatrie du sujet, (""psychiatry of the subject"") and created in particular the SOFOR (Sud Ouest Formation Recherche), which developed training activities for caregivers.

In 1992, he became president of the Sarajevo Association, in support of the Bosnian people, and was a candidate on the list Europe Begins at Sarajevo of professor Léon Schwartzenberg for the 1994 European Parliament election.

Jeanson was born on 6 March 1900 in Paris. His father was a teacher. Before becoming a journalist, he had several casual jobs, including being depicted as a soldier on a good-luck card for a postcard seller, belying his future pacifism. In 1917, he started work for La Bataille, newspaper of the Confédération générale du travail. Noted for his strong writing, he was a journalist throughout the 1920s, with intervening stints as reporter, interviewer and film critic. He was distinguished by the potency of his style and a taste for polemic. Jeanson worked for several papers including the Journal du peuple, Hommes du Jour and the Canard enchaîné, where he defended complete pacifism.

He resigned from the Canard enchaîné in 1937, in solidarity with Jean Galtier-Boissière.

He was sentenced to 18 months in prison in July 1939, for publishing an article in Solidarité internationale antifasciste, a periodical founded in November 1938 by Louis Lecoin, in which he congratulated Herschel Grynszpan for his assassination of Ernst vom Rath, an official of the German embassy in Paris. He was arrested in November 1939, at which time he had already joined his regiment in Meaux, for articles which had appeared in March and August 1939, and for having signed Louis Lecoin's tract ""Paix immédiate"". On 20 December 1939, he was sentenced by a military tribunal to five years in prison for ""calling for disobedience within the ranks"".

Jeanson was in prison for his pacifist writings, and this only a few days before the German army marched into Paris. His freedom was obtained by the lawyer and minister César Campinchi. He remained in Paris and in August 1940 was given the chief editorship of Aujourd'hui, an ""independent"" newspaper. The first issue went out on 10 September 1940. In November 1940, the German authorities pressured him to take a public position against the Jews and in favour of the politics of collaboration with the Vichy regime. Jeanson resigned and went back to prison. He was freed a few months later after the intervention of his friend Gaston Bergery, a neo-radical who had turned to the collaborationists through ultra-pacifism. From that point on he was banned from the press and the cinema, and worked secretly, writing film dialogues without putting his name to them. With Pierre Bénard, Jeanson participated in the development of secret pamphlets, and just missed being re-arrested in 1942. He continued to lie low until the liberation of France.

His story is said to illustrate the contradictions and compromises of absolute pacifism: the willingness to seek an understanding with Germany to avoid war, transforming, after France's defeat, into a desire for proper coexistence, even offering to serve the Germans. The newspaper Aujourd'hui was far from being innocent in its hunting down those allegedly responsible for France's defeat, resorting to the ""clean sweep of the broom"" myth in its Anglophobia. The paper entered into resonance with Marshal Philippe Pétain's narrative, and took the direction of German propaganda. ...

Kaurismäki's most acclaimed film has been The Man Without a Past, which won the Grand Prix and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Film category in 2003. However, Kaurismäki refused to attend the Oscar ceremony, asserting that he did not feel like partying in a country that was in a state of war. Kaurismäki's next film Lights in the Dusk was also chosen to be Finland's nominee for best foreign-language film, but Kaurismäki again boycotted the awards and refused the nomination, as a protest against U.S. President George W. Bush's foreign policy. In 2002 Kaurismäki also boycotted the 40th New York Film Festival in a show of solidarity with the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, who was not given a US visa in time for the festival. Kaurismäki's 2017 film The Other Side of Hope won the Silver Bear for Best Director award at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival. At the same festival he also announced that it would be his last film, although the retirement was short-lived as he began filming Fallen Leaves in 2022, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023.",1957-04-04,,16767.0,Directing,"Orimattila, Finland",3.0917,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//t0pdsYfLts7p01OBN1P9UHp1Z0l.jpg

Born as Luciano Stella, Kendall was formerly a model for Italian Fumetti, comics done in photographs.

He changed his name to Tony Kendall at the suggestion of Vittorio De Sica in the fashion of many Italian actors whose films were shown in countries outside of Italy in the days when European films proliferated. Stella made his film debut in Femmine Tre Volte in 1959 but didn't make another appearance until he used his new name of Tony Kendall in Brennus, Enemy of Rome (1963) one of the sword and sandal craze of films popular in the early 1960s.

Kendall is most famous for his various teamings with Brad Harris, with the two predating Terence Hill and Bud Spencer as a popular and prolific action team. In the derivative world of the European cinema of the 1960s, Kendall and Harris first teamed up in two sauerkraut western films ""inspired"" by the successful German Karl May Winnetou series with Harris as a Lex Barker clone and Kendall as a Native American ""Chief Black Eagle"" in The Pirates of the Mississippi (1963) and Black Eagle of Santa Fe (1965).

With the international success of the James Bond films and the German Jerry Cotton series, Kendall became best known for his role as private detective Joe Walker in the seven films of the Eurospy Kommissar X series where he played opposite Brad Harris in the role of New York Police Captain Tom Rowland. The popularity of Batman (TV series) led to Harris and Kendall appearing in The Three Fantastic Supermen (1967) the first in a long series that had stunt work performed by a young Jackie Chan (“The Three Fantastic Supermen in the Orient”).

Kendall has prominently appeared in other varieties of European cinema in the 1960s and 1970s such as Giallo horror (The Whip and the Body, 1963), spaghetti westerns (as Django in Django Against Sartana, 1970, and Gunman of 100 Crosses, 1971), crime movies such as Machine Gun McCain (1969), and adventure films such as Oil!

Trained as a painter, Klein studied under Fernand Léger and found early success with exhibitions of his work. However, he soon moved on to photography and achieved widespread fame as a fashion photographer for Vogue and for his photo essays on various cities. Despite having no training as a photographer, Klein won the Prix Nadar in 1957 for New York, a book of photographs taken during a brief return to his hometown in 1954. Klein's work was considered revolutionary for its ""ambivalent and ironic approach to the world of fashion"", its ""uncompromising rejection of the then prevailing rules of photography"" and for his extensive use of wide-angle and telephoto lenses, natural lighting and motion blur. Klein tends to be cited in photography books along with Robert Frank as among the fathers of street photography, one of those mixed compliments that classifies a man who is hard to classify. The world of fashion would become the subject for Klein's first feature film, Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?, which, like his other two fiction features, Mr. Freedom and Le Couple Témoin, is a satire.

Klein directed numerous short and feature-length documentaries and produced over 250 television commercials.

Though American by birth, Klein lived and worked in France since his late teens. His work has sometimes been openly critical of American society and foreign policy; the film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum once wrote that Klein's 1968 satire Mr. Freedom was ""conceivably the most anti-American movie ever made"".

Educated in France, Kotto immigrated to Quebec, Canada, where he was an educator before entering politics. Kotto was a Parti Québécois member of the National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of Bourget. From 2012 to 2014, he served as the Minister of Culture and Communications. A former member of the House of Commons of Canada for the Bloc Québécois, Kotto is also a published author and has appeared in films.

Kotto was born in Douala, Cameroon, and graduated from high school at Lycée Henri-Martin in Saint-Quentin, France. He studied law, politics, dramatic art and cinema in Nanterre, Bordeaux and Paris. Kotto immigrated to Quebec in 2006.

Before becoming a politician, Kotto was an author, actor, and stage director. He appeared in the 1989 movie How to Make Love to a Negro Without Getting Tired (Comment faire l'amour avec un nègre sans se fatiguer), based on the novel by Dany Laferrière. He also appeared in a second film in 2000, Lumumba, starring as Joseph Kasa-Vubu.

Kotto was also an educator in dramatic art for nearly 15 years in France and Quebec.

Kotto was elected to the House of Commons of Canada, representing the Bloc Québécois in the 2004 Canadian federal election. In that election, he defeated incumbent Liberal MP Yolande Thibeault and five other candidates. Upon winning the Saint-Lambert riding, Kotto became the first black Canadian Member of Parliament for the Bloc. He was re-elected two years later, winning a comfortable, but reduced, popular vote and a much larger plurality in the 2006 Canadian federal election. He defeated five other candidates to win his second term in office.

Kotto served as the Bloc's critic for Canadian heritage.

On November 12, 2007, Kotto announced that he would be the candidate for the Parti Québécois in the provincial riding of Bourget in Montreal to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of former PQ house leader Diane Lemieux. It was his second attempt at provincial politics; he was defeated in his previous candidacy in Viau by former Liberal MNA William Cusano.

Kotto resigned his seat in House of Commons of Canada on March 5, 2008, in order to run in the provincial by-election. His vacancy was officially recognized by the Speaker on March 13, 2008.

On May 12, 2008, he won the Bourget by-election as a Parti Québécois candidate with 40% of the vote.

With the election of the Parti Québécois on September 4, 2012, Kotto became Minister of Culture and Communications.

Kotto was re-elected in the 2014 Quebec election with a smaller margin, but the Parti Québécois government of Pauline Marois was defeated and Kotto became a member of the Official Opposition caucus. He was defeated in the 2018 election.

Kotto is the husband of former Longueuil mayor and Bloc Québécois caucus colleague Caroline St-Hilaire, and is the father of four children.

Jan Kounen (born 2 May 1964, Utrecht, Netherlands) is a Dutch-born French film director and producer. In France, he is mostly known for his films Dobermann (1997), Blueberry, l'experience secrete (2004) and 99 francs (2007).

Outside of France, he is rather known for his interest in Shipibo-Conibo culture and shamanism, with which he became familiar during his trips to Mexico and Peru, and for some music videos. Most noticeable are the four videos he did for the English pop group Erasure in the 1990s (including three for the project Abba-esque) :

In 1952, Laborit was instrumental in the development of the drug chlorpromazine, published his findings, and convinced three psychiatrists to test it on a patient, resulting in great success. Laborit was recognized for his work, but as a surgeon searching for an anesthetic, he came to be at odds with psychiatrists who made their own discoveries and competing claims.

Laborit wrote several books where he vulgarizes his ethological laboratory research and marries it, through systems thinking, with knowledge from several other disciplines, being a strong advocate of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. His writings can also be found to have deep roots in anarchist thought. He was personally untroubled by the requirements of science and the constraints of university life. He maintained an independence from academia and never sought to produce the orderly results that science requires of its adherents.

Henri Laborit was born in Hanoi, French Indochina, in 1914. His father was a physician and colonial officer who died in 1920 from tetanus. Laborit contracted tuberculosis at age 12. In Paris, he earned a baccalaureate. He spent two years in Indochina on a hospital ship. He passed the examinations at the Naval Health Service in Bordeaux, and became a navy physician. He was sent to Sidi Abdallah, Bizerte. Feeling that his options for recognition would be better, he switched to become a surgeon. During World War II he was stationed on the torpedo boat Sirocco, where he witnessed the evacuation of the Dunkerque, and then was sunk by the Germans. He was saved by an English sloop that picked him up. He received the French Military Cross with distinction. He was later stationed in Dakar. By about 1949 he was appointed to Val-de-Grâce hospital in Paris.

Laborit was the first to recognize the potential psychiatric uses of chlorpromazine. The science of anesthesiology was new since the 1930s. Surgeons were sometimes responsible for anesthetics and as a French navy surgeon, Laborit had seen patients die as a result of or after their operations. He became a researcher in anesthesiology. Laborit's ideas on anesthesia included potentiated anaesthesia, lowering basal metabolism and lowering body temperature (so-called artificial hibernation). He advocated the use of procaine, synthetic antihistamines, Diparcol (diethazine), tetraethylammonium bromide and vitamin B1. He did not like to use morphine. In his years in Bizerte he became interested in the use of the antihistamine promethazine to make patients more relaxed before surgery and in contributing to anesthesia, observations that were the forerunner of his later interest in chlorpromazine. ...

After this film she became very popular and interpreted many roles in the 1960s. She married director Jean-Gabriel Albicocco, who cast her in some of his own works, including La Fille aux Yeux d'Or (The Girl with the Golden Eyes), based on the Balzac story, which would become her nickname.

Maïwenn starred in several films as a child, then teen, actress—notably as ""Elle, as a child"" (the child version of the lead role played by Isabelle Adjani) in the 1983 hit film L'été meurtrier (One Deadly Summer).

Following her marriage to director Luc Besson and the birth of their daughter in 1993, Maïwenn interrupted her career for several years. During this period, she only appeared in a supporting part in Besson's Léon (1994), in which she was credited as Ouin-Ouin. She also directed the film's making-of. Perhaps Maïwenn's most internationally-seen film role was her appearance as the alien Diva Plavalaguna in Besson's The Fifth Element (1997).

After she and Besson divorced, Maïwenn returned to France. She performed as a stand-up comedian in an autobiographical one-woman-show, and reentered the movie business after several filmmakers saw her comedy routine in Paris. She appeared in several notable movies, including the horror film Haute Tension (English title: High Tension), in which she starred opposite Cécile de France. By the time the film came out in 2003, she had decided she wanted to try directing.

In 2006, Maïwenn wrote and directed her first feature film, Pardonnez-moi, a drama about a dysfunctional family.[6][10] She also starred in the film which earned her nominations for the César Award for Best First Feature Film and César Award for Most Promising Actress in the 2007. Her second film was Le bal des actrices (2009, All About Actresses), in which she appears as herself making a documentary. She achieved international recognition when her third film, the social drama Polisse (2011), won the Jury Prize at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

Maïwenn's 2015 film Mon roi was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. She co-wrote, directed, and starred in the 2020 film, DNA, an Official Selection of the 2020 Cannes Film Festival which was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic. She co-wrote, directed, and starred in her first period film, the 2023 film Jeanne du Barry about the life of Madame du Barry with Louis XV portrayed by Johnny Depp, which opened the 2023 Cannes Film Festival out of competition and earned the highest French gross for a Cannes opening film since 2013.",1976-04-17,,64210.0,Acting,"Les Lilas, Seine-Saint-Denis, France",2.0577,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//p5eS3Zq4V9eau8Xcf77bm5hrVUM.jpg

Heffron's La Révolution Française(Mademoiselle Leroy-Beaulieu acted out the role of Charlotte Corday in the latter production), whose release in 1989 was timed to coincide with celebrations for the bi-centenary of the 1789 Revolution.

She has created choreographies for the Paris Opera Ballet, The Berlin Ballet, the Metropolitan Opera, for filmmakers like Pedro Almodóvar and Michel Gondry or for musical artists like Beyoncé, Daft Punk (""Around the World"" ), Paul McCartney, Kanye West and Coldplay, among others. Whether performance, opera, musical, museum installation, event, music video or feature film, she initiates and realizes a great number of projects: ""I like to give life to all that’s in my brain"". Never restricted to one style, she gets her inspiration from a broad spectrum of physical forms of expression (from flamenco to classical ballet and hip-hop).

Blanca Li, originally Blanca María Gutiérrez Ortiz, was born in 1964 in Granada, in a nine-member family. She started to take Flamenco dance lessons during her childhood and participated in a contest to join the Spanish Rhythmic Gymnastics Team. She was accepted at the age of twelve, but she abandoned the team six months before the Olympics because of growth disorders. However, due to her need for physical activity, she decided to replace gymnastics with dance.

She moved to New York at the age of seventeen, where she was trained for five years as a dancer and choreographer at Martha Graham’s School. She also studied with Alvin Ailey, Paul Sanasardo and Merce Cunningham.

In New York she lived in Harlem, where she witnessed the birth of hip hop. Her first show took place in the East Village and it was a mix of different styles: classical, modern and hip hop dance. During those years, Blanca met Etienne Li, a mathematician who was also a Franco-Korean graffiti artist. He designed the pamphlets of her first show and would later become her partner.

During her time in New York, she created Xoxonees with her sister, a flamenco-rap band in which they danced wearing flamenco dressed. They received an offer in Spain, where they released an homonymous album in 1989. In the late eighties, she founded her first company in Madrid, a company she performed with in the Universal Exposition of Seville in 1992, also known as “Expo 92”.

Later that year, she moved to Paris. During her first year in the French capital, she worked in a cabaret at Place Pigalle where she introduced herself to singers and other artists.

She settles in Paris in 1993 to install her own contemporary dance company, with 14 major pieces at her repertory since. She opens up her own dance studios in Paris in 1998. Fusion between disciplines and a very Latin sense of humor are present in most of her creations. Macadam Macadam, a hip-hop piece commissioned by Suresnes Cite Danse Festival in 1999, becomes the reference of the genre, while touring worldwide, from Avignon Festival to Festival of Arts and Ideas in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2006, in a series performed at the Théâtre Mogador of Paris, Macadam Macadam receives the Globes de Cristal for Best Musical. She creates her first one-woman show Zap! Zap! Zap!, which is successfully performed at Théâtre national de Chaillot in Paris and at The Kitchen in New York City for the France Moves Festival (2001). ...

He grew up around the neighbourhood of Goutte d'Or in Paris's 18th arrondissement. When he was 13, his mother apprenticed him to a hairdresser in a trendy parlor on Avenue Matignon, where he would take the name of the hairdresser's son, Fabrice, in place of his real name, Robert. At the same time he developed a great interest for literature (Balzac, Flaubert, Proust). His passion for soul music (James Brown) made him a regular of discothèques. This is where he met Philippe Labro, who gave him his first role in Tout peut arriver in 1969. He then studied acting under Jean-Laurent Cochet. However, it was his collaboration with Éric Rohmer that would make him popular for Le Genou de Claire in 1970, in which he played a small role as an adolescent. He appeared in Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois, and Les Nuits de la pleine lune, and in films directed by Nagisa Oshima, Pierre Zucca, Claude Lelouch, Cedric Klapisch, Édouard Molinaro.

Thanks to Jean-Laurent Cochet, he later discovered theater, his true passion, which he described as ""the only place where life is expressed... something that no school will ever teach"". However, it was his role in La Discrète, directed by Christian Vincent in 1990, that made him well-known to the general public. He divides his work between cinema and theater, where since 1980 he has had considerable success with readings from the texts of La Fontaine, Nietzsche, Céline's Voyage au bout de la nuit, Paul Valéry and Roland Barthes.

Gaston Ghrenassia was born to a Sephardic Jewish family. His father, Sylvain Ghrenassia (1914–2004), was a violinist in an orchestra that played primarily malouf, Andalusian classical music. Gaston played the guitar from childhood, and started playing with the Cheikh Raymond Leyris Orchestra at age 15.

He pursued a school teacher career, but continued playing the guitar. In 1961, the Algerian War of Independence was raging, and the situation became untenable for the European colonizers of Constantine. The assassination in 1961 of his father-in-law and musician Cheikh Raymond Leyris by the National Liberation Front (FLN) was of immense effect on Gaston Ghrenassia, and appears to have been due to his opposition to the independence of Algeria from France and pro-Israel stance. Gaston left Algeria with his wife, Suzy, on 29 July 1961, eleven months before the end of the Algerian War of Independence, and went into exile in mainland France. He has not been permitted to return to Algeria ever since.

First living in Argenteuil, he eventually moved to Paris, where he decided to pursue a career in music. At first he tried translating into French the malouf numbers which he already knew. Later on, he developed a new French repertoire that he performed in cafés and cabarets. He remained, though, a popular interpreter of Arab-Andalusian music and Judeo-Arab songs in France.

He adopted the stage name Enrico Macias and made his first recording in 1962 after a meeting with Raymond Bernard of Pathé. The result was the recording of ""Adieu mon pays"" which he had composed for his beloved Algeria on the ship on his way to France. He appeared on French television and became an overnight sensation. This led to a first tour in 1963 as a second act with Paola and Billy Bridge. His daughter, Jocya, was also born that year.

In spring 1964, he opened for Les Compagnons de la chanson at the Paris Olympia and then undertook a successful tour of the Middle East, performing with great success in Israel, Greece and Turkey, especially in the latter where he still has a huge following. In Turkey, many of his songs were translated and interpreted by Turkish artists. In 1965, he was awarded the Prix Vincent Scotto, and the following year he sang before 120,000 people at the Dinamo Stadium in Moscow, performing concerts in more than 40 other Soviet cities. He also toured Japan and recorded titles in Spanish and Italian and was popular in both countries.

His American debut, at a sold-out Carnegie Hall concert, took place on 17 February 1968. He continued to tour the United States, singing in Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles. In Quebec, Canada, he was warmly welcomed as a Francophone artist. ...

Her husband Michel Emer, who was Edith Piaf's composer, helped her hide her bisexuality (if not her sole homosexuality) from the public as they lived as a 'free couple' when it was then deeply stigmatized during the 1950s and 1960s. She was made a Chevalier (French: Knight) of the Légion d'honneur and Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

He has shared his longtime exploration of the body as an instrument of theatrical expression through workshops and classes for actors, dancers, and singers, throughout the world. He was a winner of a Golden Mask award in 2006, as director of the opera Il Viaggio a Reims.

Alain Maratrat was born in Paris into a family far from the world of art; his father was a train conductor and his mother had stopped working as a dressmaker to raise her children. He attended the Institute National des Arts du Spectacle in Brussels, Belgium from 1969 to 1973 and, thirty years later, joined 3 fellow students from the class of ‘73 to play their younger selves in Trente Ans a Peine, a play by Jean-Claude Carrière, which was based on their acting aspirations and experiences at INSAS.

In 1974 Maratrat was invited to join Peter Brook’ s company, the International Centre for Theatre Research, and he remained an active member of the company for nearly 20 years, participating in most of the company's successful productions. He acted, experimented and traveled the world with Brook's multi-cultural assembly of actors, dancers, musicians and other performers. They participated in theatrical encounters with audiences in native villages, asylums schools and a prison, as well as traditional theaters throughout the world. Working with Brook fed and developed Maratrat's interest in creating theater that would touch and enliven ordinary people, regardless of their culture. Since leaving Brook's company, Maratrat has managed active careers as an actor (film, theater and television), theater and opera director, and acting teacher.

He has performed in films by directors Claude Berri, Amos Gitai, Michel Deville and Alain Berberian and plays directed by Bruno Bayen, Philippe Mantha, Gabriel Garran, Peter Brook, Dominique Mühler, Bernard Sobel and Gaston Jung. Maratrat has directed theatrical productions of Ferenc Molnár's Liliom (1991), Dumas’ The Three Musketeers (1993) and Gaston Salvatore's Staline (1994). Braz's Rencontres (1995) was staged after a year-long collective workshop. He directed Goldoni's The Impresario from Smyrna and The Dance Lesson (1996). In 1998 he directed The Conference of Birds with the Teatro Kismet and a group of international actors in Bari, Italy, and in 1999 he traveled to South Africa to direct Romeo was a Shoeshiner with social centers in the townships of Pretoria. More recent productions include Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night ́s Dream (2003), Chekhov's The Three Sisters (2004), Ibsen's Peer Gynt (2004), Marivaux's The Dispute (2005), Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night (2006) and Schiller's Marie Stuart (2011). ...

She entered the National Superior Conservatory of Dramatic Art in 1913 and studied under Paul Mounet. She failed her final exams, but was immediately engaged in the company of Sarah Bernhardt, who was a great friend of the family. She went on play alongside her in The Eugene Morand cathedral.

She became established with her role in L'Aiglon by Edmond Rostand, whose mistress she became from 1915 to his death in 1918. She made her film debut in 1914 in a silent film, Les Frères ennemis, which was never finished. Her first major film role was in Sappho, produced by Léonce Perret in 1932. After World War I, she joined the Comédie-Française in 1923 where she stayed for over twenty years, before moving to the boulevard Theatre.

During the World War II, throughout the occupation, she sought the protection of German officers to protect her son who had told her of his intention to join the Resistance. The response was his arrest and deportation to Buchenwald concentration camp where he died aged 21. This was possibly the cause of her problems at the time of the Liberation when, due to her alleged relations with the enemy, Marquet was arrested and sent to Drancy and then to Fresnes. She was later released for lack of evidence.

In the 1950s, she turned to poetry recital, while continuing her career in theater on the boulevards. She worked for ORTF in the Maigret episodes of Les Cinq Dernières Minutes and Les Saintes Chéries and in the television adaptation of Lucien Leuwen, the novel by Stendhal.

Parallel to her acting career, as an antiquarian she ran a stand for many years at the Swiss Village, an important antique market in Paris where she demonstrated her skills as a saleswoman, mixing theatrical memorabilia with commercial interests.

Among her most successful parts in over forty films, were her roles in, Landru in 1962, Claude Chabrol, La Grande Vadrouille in 1966 by Gérard Oury, and Casanova in 1975 by Federico Fellini. After these three minor parts she played important roles in La vie de château (1966) the mother of Philippe Noiret and the stepmother of Catherine Deneuve and the Le malin plaisir (1975) with Claude Jade and Anny Duperey.

Mary Marquet and Victor Francen on their wedding day in 1934.

Her first lover was Edmond Rostand around 1915, living together for three years. In 1920 she married Maurice Escande, the future director of the house of Molière, ending in divorce in 1921, before meeting Firmin Gémier, the director of the new Théâtre National Populaire, who was still married but whose wife was barren. In 1922, Marquet gave birth to their son.

Before the death of Gémier in 1933, Marquet became the mistress of the president of the then Council, André Tardieu, in a semi-official liaison. Having broken up with Tardieu, she married Victor Francen. The couple separated after seven years together. Marquet died of heart attack at the age of 84 in her apartment in the Rue Carpeaux, She is buried in Montmartre Cemetery.

Coming from a Berry family, he spent part of his childhood in Biarritz, where his father worked for a furrier. During the Second World War, he hid to escape the Forced Labor Service. Staying in Paris, he appeared in two films by Maurice Tourneur: ""The Devil's Hand"" (1942) then ""Cécile Est Mort"" (1943). At the twilight of the forties, he started doing theater.

In 1953, Jean Martin gained notoriety by playing the new play by Irish playwright Samuel Beckett, ""Waiting for Godot"", under the direction of Roger Blin, becoming the first to take on the role of Lucky. The same Roger Blin produced “End of the Game” (1957), by the same Beckett, a few years later, and entrusted the same Jean Martin with the role of Clov. In 1960, Jean Martin staged his first play, “Letter Dead”, by Robert Pinget. In 1962, he again staged a play, “The Representatives”, by Aglaé and Mona Mitropoulos, adapted by Michel Arnaud. Alongside this theatrical career which would prove to be rich, Jean Martin returned to cinema: “Notre-Dame de Paris” (1956), by Jean Delannoy, “Paris belongs to us” (1958), by Jacques Rivette, “Ballade for a thug "" (1962), by Jean-Claude Bonnardot, ""La foire aux dunces"" (1963), by Louis Daquin and ""À toi de fait mignon"" (1963), by Bernard Borderie.

In 1960, he was a signatory of the Manifesto of the 121 entitled “Declaration on the right to insubordination in the Algerian war”. In 1965, a role marked his career, that of Colonel Mathieu, in a film retracing the struggle in 1957 for control of the Casbah district of Algiers between FLN militants and French soldiers: ""The Battle of Algiers"" . Three years after the end of the Algerian War, the subject is still sensitive on each side of the Mediterranean; the film was banned in France upon its release, then censored until 2004. Jean Martin, very convincing in this role of division commander (historically, the commander is General Massu, but the character is inspired by Colonel Bigeard), is the only professional actor in the film. His large stature, his strong personality and his imperious face predispose him to notable roles generally showing authority: chief doctor, police commissioner, high-ranking military officer, ecclesiastical dignitary...; one of the most impressive will undoubtedly be that of a doctor vehemently expelling from his hospital a judge Fayard, Patrick Dewaere, a bit of a cavalier in ""Le Juge Fayard Dit Le Shérif"" (1976). Claude Zidi mocks these roles in his comedies: principal in “La moutarde monte au nose” (1974), bank director in “La Course À L'Échalote” (1975), chief doctor in “L'aile ou la thigh” (1976), principal inspector in “Bête mais disciplined” (1979) and examiner in “Inspecteur la Bavure” (1980). Alongside Jean-Paul Belmondo, he is… cardinal in “L’Hériter” (1972) and… divisional commissioner in “Peur Sur La ville” (1975)! But also alongside Terence Hill in “My Name is Nobody” (1973) in the role of Sullivan, or “One Genius, Two Associates, One Bell (1975).

Mireille Mathieu was born on 22 July 1946 in Avignon, France, the eldest daughter of a family of fourteen children; the youngest brother was born after she moved to Paris. Her father Roger and his family were native to Avignon, while her mother Marcelle-Sophie (née Poirier) was from Dunkirk. She arrived in Avignon in 1944 as a refugee from World War II after her grandmother had died, and her mother went missing. Roger, with his father Arcade, ran the family stonemason shop just outside the Saint-Véran cemetery main gate. The Mathieu family have been stonemasons for four generations. Today the shop is named Pompes Funèbres Mathieu-Mardoyan, owned and managed by her sister Réjane's family.

The Mathieu family lived in poverty, with a huge improvement in their living conditions in 1954, when subsidized housing was built in the Malpeigné quarter near the cemetery. Then again in 1961 they moved to a large tenement in the Croix des Oiseaux quarter southeast of the city.

Roger had once dreamed of becoming a singer, but his father Arcade disapproved, inspiring him to have one of his children learn to sing with him in church. Mireille included her father's operatic voice on her 1968 Christmas album, where it was mixed in with the Minuit Chrétiens song. Mireille's first paid performance before an audience, at age four, was rewarded with a lollipop when she sang on Christmas Eve 1950 during Midnight Mass. A defining moment was seeing Édith Piaf sing on television.

Mireille performed poorly in elementary school because of dyslexia, requiring an extra year to graduate. She was born left-handed, and her teachers used a ruler to strike her hand each time she was caught writing with it. She became right-handed, although her left hand remains quite animated while singing. She has a fantastic memory, and never uses a prompter on stage. Abandoning higher education, at age 14 (1961), and after moving to Croix des Oiseaux, she began work in a local factory in Montfavet (a suburb southeast of town) where she helped with the family income and paid for her singing lessons. Popular at work, she often sang songs at lunch, or while working. Like her parents, she is a short woman at 1.52 m (5 feet) in height. Her sister Monique, born on 8 July 1947, began work at the same factory a few months later. Both were given bicycles on credit to commute with, making for very long days, and many bad memories of riding against the mistral winds. The factory went out of business, so Mireille and two sisters (Monique, and Christiane) became youth counselors at a summer camp before her rise to fame, a summer where she had her fortune told by Tarot cards by an old Gypsy woman, saying she would soon mingle with kings and queens. ...

Brought to light in the 1980s with her role as Marie-Jeanne in the second version of the rock opera Starmania, her best-known titles are ""Toutes les mamas"", ""Sur un prélude de Bach"" and ""Tu es mon autre"" (in a duet with Lara Fabian). She was regularly referred to as a ""golden voice of francophone song,"" or having a ""velvet voice.""

Claudine Luypaerts was born on 12 November 1960 in Ixelles, Brussels, to Guy-Philippe Luypaerts, a composer and director of Académie de Musique of Verviers, and Jeannie Patureaux, a piano teacher. When she was young, she studied the violin for a while, but was put off by all forms of schooling and began to learn to sing and play the piano on her own, before preferring the guitar.

In 1976, she was second in the Visa competition for the show and, the following year, took part in the Lundis d'Hortense, for which she adopted the stage name ""Claudie Claude"".

In 1979, Maurane took part in the show Brel en mille temps, with Philippe Lafontaine, where she was discovered by the French songwriter Pierre Barouh. Founder of the Saravah label, he produced her first singles which were released starting in 1980 under the pseudonym ""Claude Maurane"". The latter is a reference to the director Francis Morane who worked on Starmania. However, it is spelled slightly differently in order to avoid confusion with the Bob Morane comic strip, even though she is sometimes credited under this spelling.

The first singles - ""J'me roule en boule"" (1980), ""Fais soleil"" (1982), ""T'as pas la pêche"" (1984), ""Moi l'argent, toi jeune"" (1985) - did not meet with much success. She later got a string of small contracts, singing in the street or in cafés and to be a backing singer, notably for Viktor Lazlo, Jo Lemaire or Philippe Lafontaine.

Her career only really took off in 1983 when she first performed at the Sentier des Halles in Paris. The show's success allowed her to record her first album, Danser, produced by Saravah, Éditions 23 and Franc'Amour, which was released in 1986.

In 1988, Michel Berger cast her in the role of Marie-Jeanne, created in 1978 by Fabienne Thibeault. She sang in the second version of the rock opera Starmania, which toured for six months with Renaud Hantson, Sabrina Lory, Wenta, Martine St. Clair, Peter Lorne and the brothers Norman and Richard Groulx. Performing this role at the same time as her singing career proved to be difficult for her, leading her to suddenly stop performing in the rock opera.[10] She was replaced by Réjane Perry for the rest of the tour.

Her second album, Maurane, was released in 1989 on Polydor and proved to be a success, selling 150,000 copies. The album contains one of her most popular songsː ""Toutes les mamas,"" and its success led her to perform at the Olympia then on an international tour that ended in Japan. In July 1989, Maurane was awarded both the Radio France Internationale's female Octave, and the Festival d'été de Québec award. ...

Born in Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhône, France, Mesquida grew up in Le Pradet though, a little town located between Hyères and Toulon in the Var département. She was discovered at the age of 13, while walking on a road in her region, by the director Manuel Pradal who was in the middle of the casting process for his movie Marie Baie des Anges (Mary from the Bay of Angels with Vahina Giocante and Emmanuelle Béart) at the time. She took part in the shooting during the next summer after their encounter.

In 1998, she played in L'École de la chair by Benoît Jacquot and crossed paths with the controversial director who would make her well-known and, according to Mesquida, who made her learn her craft: Catherine Breillat. First they collaborated in À ma sœur! (Fat Girl), then in Sex Is Comedy, and they worked together again during the spring of 2006 on Une vieille Maîtresse with Asia Argento.

She wanted to go to Art School (the Beaux-Arts) but finally abandoned the idea to pursue her career in acting. She is still passionate about the Arts and often visits museums. Her favourite painting is The Scream by Norwegian expressionist painter Edvard Munch.

Among actors of her generation, she admires Romain Duris and Scarlett Johansson but her absolute idol is Romy Schneider and she says she has seen all her movies.

She says she is fiercely opposed to the idea of ever becoming financially dependent to cinéma and that she'd rather do baby-sitting than accept a role in a commercial movie she would not like.

His most celebrated role was that of the sadistic and vindictive headmaster in the 1955 film Les Diaboliques.

In the 1960s, he played supporting roles in numerous French films alongside French cinema stars such as Lino Ventura, Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo. In 1966, he was engaged for La grande vadrouille, where he embodied an angry SS representative. In 1968 he played in the action thriller The Devil's Garden by Yves Boisset.

Afterward he worked as a teacher in inner city schools in California and got heavily involved in personal fitness and bodybuilding. He became friends with Joe Gold (of Gold's Gym), joining Mae West's comedy act as one of her ""strongmen"" who would carry her on and off the stage. During this time he also found himself in demand as an extra in several Hollywood films including ""Lil Abner"", ""The Enemy Below"", and ""The Ten Commandments"" (in which he and Joe Gold bring Moses to Ramsey's court in chains).  When the Peplum craze began in Italy and his fellow Muscle Beach star Steve Reeves became a huge star. Gordon (along with Reg Park, Mark Forrest, Brad Harris, Mickey Hargitay, and Richard Harrison) similarly jumped on the bandwagon and headed to Italy to find stardom and financially greener pastures.

Thanks to his unconventional appearance (small, sharp eyes and craggy face) and enthusiasm for his work, Mitchell found himself one of the most in-demand performers in Italy's Sword & Sandal craze of the early 60's, working with several top directors including Marino Girolami, Alberto De Martino, and Michele Lupo. Unlike most of his peers who left Italy once the genre ran its course, Mitchell stayed on to play villains in numerous Spaghetti Westerns, Giallos, War Films, and Science Fiction movies. He also had a small but key role in the Elizabeth Taylor / Marlon Brandon vehicle ""Reflections in a Golden Eye"" (1967) during this time though perhaps his most prestigious role would be the rogue who helps the two protagonists kidnap the noble in Fellini's ""Satyricon"" (1969). Mitchell used his extra cash to buy and build his own movie studio (Cave Studios) which he single-handedly constructed outside of Rome. It went largely unused except by ultra-low budget director Demofilo Fidani who would often cast Mitchell as well.

In the late 1980's when the Italian genre film industry had basically self-destructed, unable to compete with American films even for video rentals, Mitchell packed his bags and moved back to California. Once home, he re-teamed with old friend Joe Gold to manage World Gym, at which Mitchell acted as COO and lived at the top floor of its headquarters in Marina Del Rey. Continuing for years to act in low budget films purely for the fun of it, Mitchell passed away in his sleep at age 80 in 2003.

She founded the Parisian avant-garde stage ensemble Théâtre du Soleil in 1964. She wrote and directed 1789 (1974) and Molière (1978), and directed La Nuit Miraculeuse (1989). She holds a Chair of Artistic Creation at the Collège de France, an Honorary Degree in Performing Arts from the University of Rome III, awarded in 2005 and an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Oxford University, awarded 18 June 2008.

Ariane Mnouchkine is the daughter of Jewish Russian film producer Alexandre Mnouchkine and June Hannen (daughter of Nicholas Hannen). Mnouchkine's paternal grandparents, Alexandre and Bronislawa Mnouchkine, were both deported from Drancy to Auschwitz on 17 December 1943, where they were both murdered. Ariane is the namesake of the production company Ariane Films that was founded by her father.

Mnouchkine attended Sorbonne University in Paris, France, where she studied Literature. On a year abroad at Oxford University in England, studying English Literature, she joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society, and decided to return to her roots in theatre. She founded the ATEP (Association Théâtrale des Étudiants de Paris or Parisian Students’ Theatrical Association) in 1959 when she returned to the Sorbonne. She continued theatre studies at L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, where in 1964 she founded Théâtre du Soleil (Theatre of the Sun) with her fellow students. The theatre collective still continues to create social and political critiques of local and world cultures. Théâtre du Soleil's productions are often performed in found spaces like barns or gymnasiums because Mnouchkine does not like being confined to a typical stage. Similarly, she feels theatre cannot be restricted with the ""fourth wall"". When audiences enter a Mnouchkine production, they will often find the actors preparing (putting on makeup, getting into costume) right before their eyes.

In 1971, Mnouchkine signed the Manifesto of the 343, publicly announcing she had an illegal abortion.

Mnouchkine has developed her own works, like the political-themed 1789, as well as numerous classical texts like Molière's Don Juan or Tartuffe. Between 1981 and 1984, she translated and directed a series of William Shakespeare plays: Richard II, Twelfth Night, and Henry IV, Part 1. While she developed the shows one at a time, when she finished Henry IV, she toured the three together as a cycle of plays. Similarly, she developed Iphigenia by Euripides and the Oresteia (Agamemnon, Choephori, and The Eumenides) by Aeschylus between 1990–92. ...

He is a noted writer of autofiction, the blend of autobiography and historical fiction.

In more than 40 books, Modiano used his fascination with the human experience of World War II in France to examine individual and collective identities, responsibilities, loyalties, memory, and loss. Because of his obsession with the past, he was sometimes compared to Marcel Proust. Modiano's works have been translated into more than 30 languages and have been celebrated in and around France, but most of his novels had not been translated into English before he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

Modiano previously won the 2012 Austrian State Prize for European Literature, the 2010 Prix mondial Cino Del Duca from the Institut de France for lifetime achievement, the 1978 Prix Goncourt for Rue des boutiques obscures, and the 1972 Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française for Les Boulevards de ceinture.

Jean Patrick Modiano was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, a commune in the western suburbs of Paris on July 30, 1945. His father, Albert Modiano (1912–77, born in Paris), was of Jewish-Italian origin; on his paternal side he was descended from the well known Italo-Jewish Modiano family of Thessaloniki, Greece. His mother, Louisa Colpeyn (1918–2015), was a Belgian (Flemish) actress. Modiano's parents met in occupied Paris during World War II and began their relationship semi-clandestinely (they separated shortly after Patrick's birth). His father had refused to wear the Yellow badge and did not turn himself in when Paris Jews were rounded up for deportation to Nazi concentration camps. He was picked up in February 1942, and narrowly missed being deported, after an intervention from a friend. During the war years Albert did business on the black market and was allegedly associated with the Carlingue, the French Gestapo auxiliaries which recruited its leaders from the underworld. Albert Modiano never clearly spoke of this period to his son before his death in 1977.

Patrick Modiano's childhood took place in a unique atmosphere. He was initially brought up by his maternal grandparents who taught him Flemish as his first language. The absence of his father, and frequently also of his mother, on tour, brought him closer to his two-year-younger brother, Rudy, who suddenly died of a disease at age 9 (Patrick Modiano dedicated his works from 1967 to 1982 to his brother). Recalling this tragic period in his famed memoir Un Pedigree (2005), Modiano said: ""I couldn't write an autobiography, that's why I called it a 'pedigree': It's a book less on what I did than on what others, mainly my parents, did to me."" ...

Chloé grew up in Lille in a family of musicians. She is the sister of Barnabé Mons, the leader of the psychedelic rock group Sheetah & Les Weissmullers. She later became the muse of the American photographer Tom Sewell. In 2001, she married the singer Alain Bashung, whom she met during the filming of the music video La nuit je mens and with whom she recorded the Cantique des cantiques for their wedding, using music by Rudolphe Burger. They have a daughter together named Poppée.

In 2006, inspired by Calamity Jane's Letters to My Daughter, she wrote and composed La Ballade de Calamity Jane. Alain Bashung, her husband, and Rodolphe Burger, the guitarist and leader of the band Kat Onoma, helped bring the project to life. In the same year, she published her debut solo album, Chienne d'un seul, which she performed on stage during the first part of her husband's tour, La Tournée des grands espaces. In 2009, she wrote, composed and self-produced her second solo album, Par la rivière, an opus she defines as ""punk/country"" and that she played alone or with a small band in France and the United States.

Her third solo album, Walking, was recorded at the end of 2010 in Kingston, New York, and produced by Malcolm Burn, who has worked with Bob Dylan, Iggy Pop, and Emmylou Harris among others. She brought Walking on tour, accompanied by guitarist Yan Péchin.

After her husband Alain Bashung's death in 2009, Mons published a diary-style book recounting her husband's final hours. The book, Let Go, was released on 2 March 2012, by the publisher Fetjaine.

2012 also marked the release of Il Buio, a duet album with the guitarist Xavier Boussiron. The album comprises covers of various hits from the 1950s, from Peggy Lee's ""Johnny Guitar"" to Adriano Celentano's ""Ciao Ragazzi"". Also of note, Salvatore Adamo joins Mons to rejuvenate his original song, ""La Notte"". Then, in November 2012, Mons reunited with the team from Walking to record Soon, and then left for southern India, Mysore, Karnataka, to film ""American Diary"", ""My California"", and ""Mysore Express"".

In 2016, she played Dominique in Alain Klingler's musical, Je n’ai rien contre le réveillon.

The same year, she released her eighth album, Alectrona, in which she contrasted the codes of rock 'n roll with the classical form of chamber music. She wrote and composed 10 songs, which she then entrusted to Blixa Bargeld for production.

Mons is the sister of Barnabé Mons, leader of the Lille-based psychedelic rock band Sheetah & Les Weissmullers. She became the muse of the American photographer Tom Sewell before marrying the singer Alain Bashung in 2001. She met Bashung while shooting the music video La nuit je mens, and for their marriage they recorded Song of Songs, set to Rodolphe Burger's music. They have a daughter named Poppée.

Montagnani was born in Alessandria, Piedmont, and debuted as theatre actor thanks to the help of Erminio Macario. His first cinema success was his dramatic role in Metello (1970), but he later switched to the commedia all'italiana with his roles in the last two chapters of the Amici miei series (1982 and 1985). In the 1980s he also participated to a TV show as Don Fumino, an easy-speaking Tuscan parish priest.

Montagnani also intensively worked as dubber, dubbing actors such as Michel Piccoli, Charles Bronson and Philippe Noiret for the Italian version of movies. He was also the Italian voice of Thomas O'Malley in the 1970 Disney film The Aristocats.

In his later years he participated to numerous commedia sexy all'italiana films, often pairing with Edwige Fenech, the most popular actress of the genre, and also with Alvaro Vitali as the comic sidekick.

In 1959, Montagnani married Eileen Jarvis, who was a member of the Bluebell Girls. In 1963, they had one son, Daniele.

He is said to be one of France's greatest 20th-century artists.

Montand was born Ivo Livi in Stignano, a small village in the hills of Monsummano Terme, Italy, to Giovanni Livi, a broom manufacturer. Montand's mother Giuseppina Simoni was a devout Catholic. The family left Italy for France in 1923 following fascist Benito Mussolini's rise to power. He grew up in Marseille, where, as a young man, he worked in his sister's beauty salon (Salon de Coiffure), as well as later on the docks. He began a career in show business as a music-hall singer. In 1944, he was discovered by Édith Piaf in Paris; she made him part of her act.

Montand achieved international recognition as a singer and actor, starring in many films. He is recognised for crooner style songs, with those about Paris becoming instant classics. He was one of the best known performers at Bruno Coquatrix's Paris Olympia music hall, and toured with musicians including Didi Duprat. In October 1947, he sang ""Mais qu'est-ce que j'ai?"" (music by Henri Betti and lyrics by Édith Piaf) at the Théâtre de l'Étoile. Betti also asked him to sing ""C'est si bon"" but Montand refused. Following the success of the recording of this song by the Sœurs Étienne in 1948, he decided to record it. Montand was also very popular in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where he did a concert tour in 1956-57.

During his career, Montand acted in American motion pictures as well as on Broadway. He was nominated for a César Award for Best Actor in 1980 for I comme Icare and again in 1984 for Garçon! In 1986, after his international box-office draw power had fallen off considerably, the 65-year-old Montand gave one of his best remembered performances, as the scheming uncle in Jean de Florette, co-starring Gérard Depardieu, and Manon des Sources (both 1986), co-starring Emmanuelle Béart. The film was a worldwide critical hit and revived Montand's profile in the United States, where he made an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman.

In 1951, he married Simone Signoret, and they co-starred in several films throughout their careers. The marriage was, by all accounts, fairly harmonious, lasting until her death in 1985, although Montand had a number of well-publicised affairs, notably with American actress Marilyn Monroe, with whom he starred in one of her final films, Let's Make Love. He was the stepfather to Signoret's daughter from her previous marriage, Catherine Allégret.

Montand's only child, a son named Valentin, by his second wife, Carole Amiel (b. 1960), was born in 1988. In a paternity suit that caused commotion across France, another woman accused Montand of being the father of her daughter and went to court to obtain a DNA sample from him. Montand refused, but the woman persisted even after his death. In a court ruling that made international headlines, the woman won the right to have Montand exhumed and a sample taken. The results indicated that he was not the girl's biological father.

He supported left-wing causes during the 1950s and 1960s, and attended Communist festivals and meetings. ...

Morlay began acting in the era of silent films, and became known as co-star with Max Linder in his ""Max"" series. She starred in a series of ""Gaby"" films such as Gaby en auto (1917) and more than 20 other silent films. She moved easily into talking films in the early 1930s. She played Queen Victoria in the 1939 historical film Entente cordiale.

She had an affair with the government minister Max Bonnafous (1900–75) during World War II, and as a result, she was investigated for collaboration with the Nazis after the liberation of France. Later she married Bonnafous. Morlay continued to play important roles in the 1940s and 1950s.

She was an art lover and was a friend and admirer of the Italian painter Beretta Dimario who lived in Nice.

He was inspired by the adventures of the historic Dalton Gang and other outlaws. It was a bestselling series for more than 50 years that was translated into 23 languages and published internationally. He collaborated for two decades with French writer René Goscinny on the series. Morris's pen name is an Anglicized version of his first name.

Born in Kortrijk, Belgium, Morris attended the well-known Jesuit college in Aalst. His math teacher told his parents the youth would unfortunately never succeed in life, as he passed math classes doodling in the margin of his math books. The student uniforms required there inspired his choices for those of the undertakers in his Lucky Luke cartoon series.

Morris started his career after college drawing in the Compagnie Belge d'Actualités (CBA) animation studios. This was a small and short-lived Belgian animation studio, where he met fellow artists Peyo, André Franquin and Eddy Paape.

After World War II, the company folded. Morris worked as an illustrator for Het Laatste Nieuws, a Flemish newspaper, and Le Moustique, a French-language weekly magazine published by Dupuis. He made some 250 covers and numerous other illustrations for the latter magazine, mainly caricatures of movie stars.

Morris died in 2001 of an embolism following an accidental fall.

In 1946, Morris created Lucky Luke for Spirou magazine, the Franco-Belgian comics magazine published by Dupuis. Lucky Luke is a solitary cowboy who travels across the Wild West, helping those in need and aided by his faithful horse, Jolly Jumper. The first adventure, ""Arizona 1880"", was published in L'Almanach Spirou 1947, released on 7 December 1946.

Morris became one of the central artists of the magazine. He was one of the so-called La bande des quatre (Gang of Four), with Jijé, André Franquin, and Will. All four lived and worked for a couple of years at Jijé's studio in Waterloo, and became very good friends, stimulating each other artistically.

In 1948, Morris, Jijé and Franquin travelled to the United States (Will was still too young and had to remain in Belgium). They wanted to get to know the country, see what was left of the Wild West, and meet some American comic artists. Morris stayed the longest of the three, for six years. During his six-year stay in the U.S. Morris met Jack Davis and Harvey Kurtzman, and assisted them with founding their Mad magazine at EC Comics. In the U.S. he also met René Goscinny, a French comic artist and writer.

They developed a long collaboration, and Goscinny wrote all the Lucky Luke stories between 1955 and his death in 1977. In the 1950s, Goscinny was still fairly unknown, but he became the most successful comic writer in Europe, first with Lucky Luke and a few years later with his Asterix series. ...

She appeared in works by Luigi Pirandello, (Vêtir ceux qui sont nus), and Alfred de Musset, (Les Caprices de Marianne), amongst others, and directed La Petite dame with Claude Guyonnet in 1992. She returned to the screen in Jean-Pierre Mocky's Bonsoir 1993, and in Louis and Xavier Bachelot's short film La Plante.

Georges Neveux (1900-1982) was a French dramatist and poet.

Neveux's first notable work was the play Juliette ou la clé des songes (Juliet or the key to dreams), written in 1927 and produced in 1930. It became the basis of Theodor Schaefer's melodrama Julie aneb Snar (Julie or the Book of Dreams) for piano, jazz instruments, and small orchestra, from 1934, Bohuslav Martinů's opera, Julietta, from 1937, and for the 1951 film Juliette, or Key of Dreams.

During the 1930s, when he was general secretary of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, he wrote little. In 1943 appeared Le Voyage de Thésée (The Voyage of Theseus), which was also later adapted by Martinů as an opera (Ariane, 1958). In 1945 he translated and adapted Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.

Neveux also wrote numerous filmscripts, although he greatly preferred the theatre; as he said, 'the first because one must earn a living, the second because one must deserve to live'.",1900-08-26,1982-08-27,1065335.0,Writing,"Poltava, Russian Empire",0.376,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//2eZjfY4fqJyWkNgGXDHbzD4RQjZ.jpg

He was part of the team on Les Grosses Têtes, a radio and TV programme. He also played the part of Geriatrix in the films Asterix and Obelix vs Caesar and Astérix at the Olympic Games.

Simon Jacques Eugène was born on 21 July 1926 to engineer Henri Berryer and his wife Marie-Thérèse (née Bonnemazou). At the time of his birth, Henri was an electrician for the director Abel Gance and grip on the film Napoléon.

The family lived in a small flat in the Rue du Fer-à-Moulin, a cinema district in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, where Simon spent the most part of his earliest years at flats 26, then 28. Very early on, his Russian uncle working at Synchro-Standard took Berryer to see the first talking pictures, which he would remember all his life.

In 1936, the family moved to Nantes when Berryer senior found work as a technician at Le Majestic cinema (later L'Olympic, then La Fabrique).

At the age of eleven, Barryer founded a comedy group called ""Sim-Art"".(age fourteen, according to other sources). In 1939, with his friend Jojo, Sim got his first award in a funny face competition organised on 15 August at Saint-Julien-de-Concelles. Age fourteen, they played truant and performed sketches in a cellar, with fake letters to their school justifying their absence. Simon later studied at De Launey technical college in Nantes.

In 1941 his parents took over a cinema, L'Éden, in the small town of Ancenis (between Nantes and Angers). The family moved from Nantes to Ancenis en 1942 and reopened the cinema. Sim continued his studies at the Joubert d'Ancenis lycée and worked as projectionist in the family business.

In 1946, the Berryer family stopped working at the Ancenis to start a film distribution company at Rennes, without success. The Berryer parents returned to Ancenis but Sim – now married – stayed in Rennes as a projectionist at Le Royal. This venue also staged musical performances, so Sim saw performances from Edith Piaf, Yves Montand, Henri Salvador, Maurice Chevalier, among others. He practiced his comedy, alone, after the performances. He won a contract as a humorous singer in a ballroom. He was spotted by Étienne Perrin, with whom he performed a comic clown act Etty et Balta.

At the end of 1953, he toured as a comic song act in the Paris cabaret clubs, often in drag, as at Madame Arthur in Montmartre. He also worked at the Crazy Horse Saloon as a dresser. This stage of his career would be resurrected in Elle boit pas, elle fume pas, elle drague pas, mais... elle cause ! by Michel Audiard, where he plays a schoolteacher who has a spare-time drag act.

In the 1960s, he was part of Jean Nohain's team producing animated children's television, and performed the Baronne de la Tronche-en-Biais in a Guy Lux production.

In the 1970s he was part of many televised sketch shows. He also performed comic sketches and songs with humourist Édouard Caillau on RTBF's Chansons à la carte. In France, he was a regular performer in short comic sketches, often in costume, on Guy Lux's programmes. ...

The son of Serge Tannenbaum, a violinist, and Marcelle Houry, a journalist, Oury studied at Lycée Janson de Sailly and at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art. He became a member of the Comédie-Française just one year before World War II, but fled to Switzerland to escape the anti-Jewish persecutions by the Vichy government.

After 1945 he restarted his career as an actor, performing in the theatre and in supporting roles in the cinema. Oury became a movie director in 1959 (The Itchy Palm (fr)) and gained his first success in 1961 with Crime Does Not Pay (Le crime ne paie pas).

Joining André Bourvil and Louis de Funès as a comic duo, he burst into commercial filmmaking with 1965's The Sucker (Le corniaud). The film was entered into the 4th Moscow International Film Festival.[1] The following year, Don't Look Now... We're Being Shot At! (La Grande Vadrouille) was even more successful, attracting the largest audiences ever in France (17.27 million admissions). This box-office record stood for decades, only surpassed in 1997 by Titanic from James Cameron.

Oury shot the 1969 comedy Le Cerveau (The Brain) in English, starring David Niven in the lead role as a criminal mastermind.

Living together with the French actress Michèle Morgan, he was the father of French writer Danièle Thompson and grandfather of actor/writer Christopher Thompson.

Born on 18 July 1923 in Paris, Maria Pacôme was the daughter of Maurice Pacôme and Germaine Hivonait. Her father was deported to Buchenwald concentration camp and her brother was shot for being a Communist. When her father came back, Pacôme often found herself defending her mother against her father's violence.

Maria began her higher education at Le Cours Simon in 1941, when she was 18. She was classmates with Michèle Morgan, Danièle Delorme, and her future spouse, Maurice Ronet. Pacôme married Ronet in 1950. She would set aside her career until their divorce in 1956.

She began her stage acting career in 1956 with La Reine et les Insurgés, written by Ugo Betti and directed by Michel Vitold. In 1958, she acted in Oscar, written by Claude Magnier. She acted alongside Pierre Mondy and Jean-Paul Belmondo in the play. Pacôme also appeared in N'écoutez pas, mesdames! by Sacha Guitry in 1962, Les Grosses Têtes by Jean Poiret and Michel Serrault in 1969, and Joyeuses Pâques by Poiret in 1981.

Pacôme's first appearance on the big screen came in 1959 with Voulez-vous danser avec moi? (Come Dance with Me), directed by Michel Boisrond. She later took on numerous supporting roles, most notably in The Troops of St. Tropez, Up to His Ears, and Le Distrait. Afterwards, she achieved leading roles in La situation est grave… mais pas désespérée by Jacques Besnard, Les Sous-doués by Claude Zidi, and The Crisis (La Crise) by Coline Serreau.

Regarded as an auteur, in 1946, he became the first filmmaker elected to the Académie française. Although his work is less fashionable than it once was, Pagnol is still generally regarded as one of France's greatest 20th-century writers and is notable for the fact that he excelled in almost every medium—memoir, novel, drama and film.

Pagnol was born on 28 February 1895 in Aubagne, Bouches-du-Rhône department, in southern France near Marseille, the eldest son of schoolteacher Joseph PagnolA and seamstress Augustine Lansot. Marcel Pagnol grew up in Marseille with his younger brothers Paul and René, and younger sister Germaine.

In July 1904, the family rented the Bastide Neuve, – a house in the sleepy Provençal village of La Treille – for the summer holidays, the first of many spent in the hilly countryside between Aubagne and Marseille. About the same time, Augustine's health, which had never been robust, began to noticeably decline and on 16 June 1910 she succumbed to a chest infection (""mal de poitrine"") and died, aged 36. Joseph remarried in 1912.

In 1913, at the age of 18, Marcel passed his baccalaureate in philosophy and started studying literature at the University in Aix-en-Provence. When World War I broke out, he was called up into the infantry at Nice but in January 1915 he was discharged because of his poor constitution (""faiblesse de constitution""). On 2 March 1916, he married Simone Colin in Marseille and in November graduated in English. He became an English teacher, teaching in various local colleges and at a lycée in Marseille.

In 1922, he moved to Paris, where he taught English until 1927, when he decided instead to devote his life to playwriting. During this time, he belonged to a group of young writers, in collaboration with one of whom, Paul Nivoix, he wrote the play, Merchants of Glory, which was produced in 1924. This was followed, in 1928, by Topaze, a satire based on ambition. Exiled in Paris, he returned nostalgically to his Provençal roots, taking this as his setting for his play Marius, which later became the first of his works to be adapted into a film in 1931.

Separated from Simone Collin since 1926 (though not divorced until 1941), he formed a relationship with the young English dancer Kitty Murphy. Their son Jacques Pagnol was born on 24 September 1930. (Jacques later became his father's assistant and subsequently a cameraman for France 3 Marseille.)

In 1929, on a visit to London, Pagnol attended a screening of one of the first talking films and he was so impressed that he decided to devote his efforts to cinema. He contacted Paramount Picture studios and suggested adapting his play Marius for cinema. This was directed by Alexander Korda and released on 10 October 1931. It became one of the first successful French-language talking films. ...

Pierre Palmade began his career in sketch comedy shows on stage and on television in the late 1980s, and in the 1990s he wrote and played his own stand-up acts. His signature humor was to portray unpleasant or irritating characters in his sketches. Palmade also wrote several plays with Muriel Robin, with whom they were notable in the 1990s for their play Ils s'aiment and its sequel Ils se sont aimés, both directed by Muriel Robin and played on stage by Palmade and Michèle Laroque. For his theater work, Palmade has been nominated several times for the Molière Awards.

In the late 1990s and 2000s, Palmade played in several films and TV series. In 2005, he participated in Rendez-vous en terre inconnue. He also worked as a writer for the films Pédale douce and Pédale dure. In 2007, he was the host of sketch comedy television show Made in Palmade; the following year, he wrote the play Le comique, which he played on stage with fellow actors from Made in Palmade and was followed by a sequel, Le Fils du Comique with Anne-Élisabeth Blateau at Théâtre Saint-Georges in Paris. In 2008, Palmade starred in the biographical film Sagan, a dramatization of the life of novelist Françoise Sagan directed by Diane Kurys, in which Palmade plays the role of dancer and socialite Jacques Chazot.

In 2010, after a ten-year hiatus from on-stage solo performances, Palmade came back with a new show J'ai jamais été aussi vieux. That same year, Palmade wrote the sketch comedy Le Grand Restaurant, featuring various celebrities such as Palmade, Anne-Élisabeth Blateau, Gérard Depardieu, François Berléand and Jean Rochefort. The prime-time television show was followed by three sequels, as of 2022. In 2018, Palmade wrote the play Paprika, played on stage at Théâtre de la Madeleine by Victoria Abril and Jean-Baptiste Maunier.

Palmade was married to singer Véronique Sanson from 1995 to 2004. In October 2008, Palmade came out as a homosexual, his homosexuality was one of the topics of his 2010 autobiographical play J'ai jamais été aussi vieux.

In an interview in 2019, after being arrested for drug use, he publicly admitted he suffered from drug addiction, declaring: ""Cocaine has ruined my life since I was 20"".

On 12 April 2019, early in the morning, Palmade reportedly called the police, telling them that a nineteen-year-old man, who was in Palmade's home in Paris, was damaging his property. When the police arrived, the young man told he was acting in self-defense, and in turn accused Palmade of raping him. Both men were put in custody.

Later that day, Palmade's accuser admitted to making a false accusation of rape and Palmade was released from custody. However, the investigation into the incident led to Palmade being indicted for drug-related charges, to which he immediately pleaded guilty. In June, Palmade (who was previously convicted of cocaine use in 1995) was sentenced to a €1,500 fine for his drug charges. His accuser was himself charged with drug use and criminal damage, and in October he was issued a three-month suspended sentence and a €500 fine. ...

Born in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, Henriette Ragon began her working life as a typist, then a factory worker, a shoeseller and an antique dealer.

In 1948, with her husband Jean Billon she took over a cabaret-restaurant in Montmartre, called Patachou. (Their son Pierre Billon had some success as a singer in the 1970s and wrote J'ai oublié de vivre for Johnny Hallyday.) She began to sing in the bistro, and journalists began to call her Patachou after the name of her cabaret (pâte-à-choux means cream puff dough). Georges Brassens sang there, and together they sang the duet ""Maman, papa"". She was the first to interpret other songs he composed such as ""Le bricoleur"", ""La chasse aux papillons"", etc.

The evening she sang them for the first time, she suggested her audience stay to the end of the show and meet the writer of these songs, and Brassens went up on to the Patachou stage for the first time and sang Le Gorille and P..de toi. Sometimes she would collect half-ties (she would snip the neckties of customers reluctant to join in the singing and immediately staple them to the ceiling, a habit which has created a very original decor of the place - hundreds of neckties hanging above) – Thomas Dewey and Errol Flynn were among her victims.

Her first records were released in 1952. She appeared at the Bobino, a Montparnasse music-hall, toured in France and then further afield. From 1953 onwards, she could be seen on-stage at the Palladium, the Waldorf Astoria, and Carnegie Hall, and throughout the United States. From the beginning of the 1970s she toured Japan and Sweden where 'L'eternal Parigot', with her cheeky Parisian register, was popular.

Patachou was made Officier of the Légion d'honneur on 1 January 2009.

Patachou died on 30 April 2015 at the age of 96.

Daniel Pennacchioni is the fourth and last son of a Corsican and Provençal family. His father was a polytechnicien who became an officer of the colonial army, reaching the rank of general at retirement and his mother, a housewife, was a self-taught reader. His childhood was spent wherever his father was stationed, in Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Algeria, Equatorial Africa), Southeast Asia (Indochina) and France (including La Colle-sur-Loup). His father's love for poetry gave him a taste for books that he quickly devoured in the family library or at school.

After studying in Nice he became a teacher. He began to write for children, including his series ""La Saga Malaussène"", that tells the story of Benjamin Malaussène, a scapegoat, and his family in Belleville, Paris. In a 1997 piece for Le Monde, Pennac stated that Malaussène's youngest brother, Le Petit, was the son of Jerome Charyn's New York detective, Isaac Sidel.

His writing style can be humorous and imaginative as in ""La Saga Malaussène"", or scholarly, as exemplified by the essay ""Comme un roman."" His comic Débauche, written jointly with Jacques Tardi, deals with unemployment.

In 1990 Pennac won the ""Prix du Livre Inter"" for La petite marchande de prose. His 1984 novel L'œil du loup was translated into English as Eye of the Wolf by Sarah Adams – later known as Sarah Ardizzone – and published by Walker Books in 2002; Adams won the biennial British Marsh Award for Children's Literature in Translation in 2005 for that work. In 2002 he won the Grinzane Cavour Prize. In 2007 Pennac won the Prix Renaudot for Chagrin d'école. He won the ""Grand Prix Metropolis bleu"" in 2008 for his complete work. In 2013 he received an honorary degree in pedagogy from the University of Bologna.

Michel Piccoli then trained as an actor first with Andrée Bauer-Théraud and then during Simon. After an appearance as an extra in ""Sortilèges"" by Christian-Jaque in 1945, Michel Piccoli made his film debut in ""Le Point Du Jour"" by Louis Daquin. In the theater he distinguished himself with the Renaud-Barrault and Grenier-Hussot companies as well as at the Théâtre de Babylone. Noticed in the film ""French Cancan"" in 1954, he continued on stage and worked with directors Jacques Audiberti, Jean Vilar, Jean-Marie Serreau, Peter Brook, Luc Bondy, Patrice Chéreau and André Engel, and became also know in popular TV movies. Having become an atheist after a family bereavement, he met Luis Buñuel in 1956, and ironically took on the role of a priest in ""La Mort En Ce Jardin"". In 1959, he shot ""Le Rendez-Vous De Noël"", a short film by André Michel based on the short story by Malek Ouary ""Le Noël Du Petit Cireur"", in Algiers. The 1960s sounded his consecration, noticed in ""Le Doulos"" by Jean-Pierre Melville, he was revealed internationally with ""Le Mépris"" by Jean-Luc Godard alongside Brigitte Bardot. From then on, he toured with the greatest French and international filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Luis Buñuel, Youssef Chahine, Manoel de Oliveira...

He began the 1980s with the interpretation prize at the Cannes festival in 1980, with ""Le Saut Dans Le Vide"" by Marco Bellocchio, and that of the Berlin festival in 1982, with ""Une Étrange Affaire"" by Pierre Granier-Deferre. .

He is most famous for his adult animated films, such as Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle.

Jean-Paul Walravens, quickly fascinated by drawing, studied at the Institute of Fine Arts Saint-Luc. In 1960, he contributed his work as a caricaturist and cartoonist for many newspapers and magazines around the world including National Lampoon and The New York Times. During this period, he adopted the pseudonym Picha. A passion for drawing led Picha to the world of comics. He is the author of several books, as Picha at Club Med (1971) or Persona non grata (1975).

After this period, he went on to animation. In 1975, he co-directed the film Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle, a raunchy parody of the Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The film was a huge success in its home country Belgium and in France, but ran through troubles with the Edgar Rice Burroughs Estate when the estate sued the creators of the film for plagiarism. The estate lost the case when the creators stated that the film was a parody. However, when the film was released in the U.S., the estate demanded that the film title and main character ""Tarzoon"" be changed due to the film's nature degrading the Tarzan name. In 1979, the now R-rated film was released under the title Shame Of The Jungle, and was rewritten by Saturday Night Live writers Anne Beatts and Michael O'Donoghue and was dubbed by John Belushi, Johnny Weissmuller, Jr., Bill Murray, and several others. Despite these efforts, the film was a critical and financial flop.

Picha's next film was the 1980 film The Missing Link. Though it wasn't as successful as Tarzoon, the film was entered into the 1980 Cannes Film Festival. Picha also adapted the film into a comic strip. In 1984, the film was released into the U.S. under the title B.C. Rock. Major changes to the film included newly written dialogue by the comedy duo The Funny Boys (Jim Vallely and Jonathan Schmock), recut footage, different voices, different instrumental score, the absence of the narrator (with the main character telling the story), and nearly all the songs written and performed by Leo Sayer have been replaced by songs by other artists (including Steel Breeze, Hall & Oates, and Rick Wakeman) in order to attract a wider audience. Unfortunately, the film was poorly promoted on video and faded into obscurity. However, this version manages to have a cult following to this day. Picha's future work would never be released in American theaters or any home video format.

Picha's next film was 1987's The Big Bang. After the small success of the film, Picha left the movie industry to concentrate on writing for television. Picha's television works included Zoo Olympics (1990–1991), Zoo Cup (1992–1993), and Buddy Buddy... A Dog's life (1995). In 2007, Picha made a comeback with Snow White: The Sequel, a parody of fairy tales, which most animated films were doing at the time.

Krzysztof Piesiewicz (Polish pronunciation: [ˈkʂɨʂtɔf pjɛˈɕɛvit͡ʂ]; born on October 25, 1945 in Warsaw, Poland) is a Polish lawyer, screenwriter, and politician, who is currently a member of the Polish Parliament and head of the Ruch Społeczny (RS) or Social Movement Party.

Piesiewicz studied law at Warsaw University and began practicing in 1973. Through the late 1970s he became increasingly involved in political cases, defending opponents of the Communist regime, serving as a legal advisor for Solidarity, and assisting in the successful prosecution of the murderers of Jerzy Popiełuszko.

In 1982 he met the film director Krzysztof Kieślowski, who was planning to direct a documentary on political show trials in Poland under martial law. Piesiewicz agreed to help, though he doubted whether an accurate film could be made within the constraints of the judicial system; indeed, the filmmakers found that their presence in court seemed to be affecting the outcomes of cases, often improving the prospects of the accused, but making it hard to capture judicial abuses.

Kieślowski decided to explore the issue through fiction instead, and the two collaborated for the first time as writers on the feature film No End, released in 1984.

Piesewicz returned to his law career, but remained in touch with Kieślowski and three years later persuaded him to create a series of films based on the Ten Commandments. This series, The Decalogue, explored the filmmakers' mutual interest in moral and ethical dilemmas in contemporary social and political life, and achieved (belated) critical acclaim around the world.

Their later collaborations, The Double Life of Véronique and Three Colors (Blue, White, Red), focused on metaphysical questions of personal choice and appeared relatively apolitical, though the latter series was based on Piesiewicz's idea of dramatizing the French political ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity in the same way they had previously dramatized the Ten Commandments.

Piesiewicz was credited as co-writer on all of Kieślowski's projects after No End, the last of which was Nadzieja, directed by Stanislaw Mucha after Kieślowski's death. He has begun writing a new series of films, The Stigmatised; the first of these, Silence, was directed by Michał Rosa and released in 2002.

Piesiewicz's career in electoral politics began in 1989, when he began working in the Social Movement for Solidarity Electoral Action (RS AWS) party, originally the political wing of the Solidarity union and the leading party in the center-right AWS coalition. In 1991 he was elected to the Polish Senate, served for two years, then returned in 1997. In 2002, RS AWS changed its name to RS and elected Piesiewicz as its leader.

Pitoëff was born in Geneva, Switzerland, on 11 March 1920, the son of Russian-born parents Ludmilla (née Smanova) and Georges Pitoëff. Both of his parents were born in the city of Tbilisi (in modern-day Georgia), then a part of the Russian Empire. The Pitoëffs were prominent actors in France, Georges was a founding member of the Cartel des Quatre (Group of Four), a group including Louis Jouvet, Charles Dullin, and Gaston Baty, dedicated to rejuvenating the French theatre.

Sacha graduated from Lycée Pasteur in Neuilly-sur-Seine, outside Paris. He studied acting and stage direction under Jouvet at the Théâtre de l'Athénée.

During World War II, the younger Pitoëff followed his mother back to Switzerland, where he played his earliest roles. After the war he returned to Paris, becoming general manager at the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord. He made his directorial debut with a 1950 staging of Uncle Vanya, which proved both a critical and commercial success.

He became a fixture of Parisian theatre in the 1960s, becoming the director of his own troupe. His repertoire included works by Jean Genet, Eugène Ionesco, Hugo Claus, Robert Musil, Anna Langfus and Anton Chekhov. With Romy Schneider, he staged The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters at Théâtre de l'Œuvre.

In 1967, he achieved his greatest success with a well-regarded production of Luigi Pirandello's Henry IV, which he directed and starred in, with Claude Jade.

Pitoëff played his first film role in 1952, in the omnibus film The Seven Deadly Sins. Appearing in over 50 films, he is probably best known for his performance in Alain Resnais's enigmatic Last Year at Marienbad (1960), as the unnamed man who may or may not be Delphine Seyrig's husband.

He was featured in roles of various sizes in such films as Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Espions (1957), Peter Ustinov's Lady L (1965), René Clément's Is Paris Burning? (1966), and Jacques Demy's Donkey Skin (1970). He also appeared in several Hollywood productions, including Anatole Litvak's Anastasia (1956) and The Night of the Generals (1967), Mark Robson's The Prize (1963) and Dick Clement's To Catch a Spy (1971).

Toward the end of his acting career, he began appearing in horror films. His final role was as the bookseller Kazanian in Dario Argento's Inferno (1980).

For the last ten years of his life, Pitoëff was a professor at the National School of Theatre Arts and Techniques (ENSATT) in Lyon, where his students included Gérard Depardieu, Jean-Roger Milo and Niels Arestrup.

Pitoëff was married to French actress Luce Garcia-Ville, until her death by suicide in 1975. He had two siblings, actress Svetlana Pitoëff and writer Aniouta Pitoeff.

His height and distinctively-gaunt, lanky appearance may have been a consequence of Marfan syndrome.

Having suffered from depression in the final years of his life, he died in Paris at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital on 21 July 1990, at the age of 70.

In 1968, Herpstu created the character of Popeck, a grumpy Eastern-European immigrant dressed in a 3-piece suit, wearing a bowler hat and speaking French with a strong Yiddish accent. Sketches featuring Popeck made Herpstu known to the larger public, and the actor identified with his character so far as to finally adopt the name Popeck for himself in 1978.

In addition to his work on stage, Popeck has acted in movies. He had a small role in Roman Polanski's The Pianist.

While primarily known as a leading French actor, André Pousse began his professional career as a cyclist (primarily track). His greatest cycling achievements took place in the infamous Vél d'Hiv (Vélodrome d'Hiver or Winter Velodrome), in Paris, where he won the prestigious ""six days of Vél d'Hiv"" races from 1942 to 1949. Indeed, Pousse is the record holder in this event, and will remain so as the Vél d'Hiv has since been torn down. The ""race,"" as it was, took place in front of 20,000 spectators and was a major French cultural and sporting event. It lasted six days and nights and, until two-man teams were established, it was apt to land exhausted participants in hospital, as Pousse himself remarked. Alain Delon, who as a child attended the races as an ardent admirer of Pousse, remembers competing with other children for the honor of bringing Pousse his bicycle at the beginning of a race. André Pousse retired from the track in 1950; and later, from 1960, went on to his better known years as an actor in cinema and television. He played mostly gangster roles in police films of the time. For many years, he was the artistic director of the Moulin Rouge in Paris and many other establishments, including the Casino of Lebanon. He also served as the agent of many French actors.

She is best known for her work as a voice actress which earned her the nickname of ""Queen"" or ""High Priestess"" of dubbing.

Pradier was born in Hanoi, French Indochina. Two years after making her film début, in 1961, she was awarded the Prix Suzanne Bianchetti as most promising new actress in France for her performance as ""Amenita"" in the Sacha Guitry film, ""Stop Thief."" That year she gained further recognition for her role as ""Constance Bonacieux"" in two films based on the Three Musketeers. Throughout the 1960s, she appeared in a number of films in her native France, then was contracted for Hollywood productions that included the Fred Zinnemann film Behold a Pale Horse (1964) starring luminaries Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, and Omar Sharif. She returned to English-language filming in the Universal Studios thriller, House of Cards (1968) with Orson Welles and George Peppard.

In her long career, Perrette Pradier has also worked in live theatre, appearing in plays such as La Bonne Addresse as well as the longest running French play ever produced, Boeing Boeing. In 1994, she was the voice of ""Sarafina"" in the French version of the Walt Disney Studios animated feature film, The Lion King.

Pradier died of a heart attack on 16 January 2013, aged 74, in Rueil-Malmaison, France, a month after being operated for an aneurysm.

She was sometimes billed as Micheline Prelle. Starting in 1939, she starred in over 50 French and English language films that were made in Hollywood and in France.

Born in Paris, she wanted to be an actress from an early age. She took acting classes in her early teens and made her film debut at the age of fifteen in the 1937 production of La Fessée. In 1938, she was awarded the Prix Suzanne Bianchetti as the most promising young actress in French cinema. Her rise to European stardom, in films such as Devil in the Flesh, led to offers from Hollywood and in 1950, she was signed by 20th Century Fox.

20th Century Fox executives changed Presle's last name to Prell. It was later changed to Prelle after a soap company brought out Prell shampoo. Her first Hollywood production was a starring role opposite John Garfield in the film Under My Skin directed by Jean Negulesco. That same year director Fritz Lang cast her opposite Tyrone Power in the war drama American Guerrilla in the Philippines. In 1950, she became the second wife of American actor William Marshall with whom she had a daughter, Tonie. William Marshall had teamed up with actor Errol Flynn and his production company and in 1951 he directed Flynn and her in the film Adventures of Captain Fabian.

Presle's marriage did not last and she returned to France, divorcing Marshall in 1954. Her career flourished in French films and in 1957 she was a guest on the American Ed Sullivan Show. In 1959 she performed in the United Kingdom English-language production of Blind Date directed by Joseph Losey. She returned to Hollywood in 1962 for the role of Sandra Dee's mother in the Universal Studios film If a Man Answers which also featured Dee's husband, singer Bobby Darin. The following year, Presle acted again in English in The Prize starring Paul Newman. She did not make another English film, but after performing in more than 50 films in French, in 1989 she appeared in the French-made bilingual production I Want to Go Home, for which she was nominated for the César Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

In 1971, Presle signed the Manifesto of the 343, publicly declaring she had an illegal abortion.

Presle died in Nogent-sur-Marne on 21 February 2024, at the age of 101, at the Maison des Artistes, a retirement home for artists, which receives partial government support. Her death was confirmed by Olivier Bomsel, her son-in-law, without specifying the cause.

He is the father of actors Sören Prévost, Erling Prévost and Christophe Prévost.

After attending drama school in Paris, Prévost made his theatre début alongside the likes of Michel Serrault in Un certain M. Blot. In his early beginnings he both performed alongside Boby Lapointe and became acquainted with Jean Yanne, later becoming one of the latter's favourite actors.

Although his television and cinema career began in the 1960s, it was in the 1970s that he found fame through Jacques Martin's satirical news programme Le petit rapporteur, the part for which he is best known.

He excelled as an evilly leering tax inspector – ""he'd audit his own mother"" in Francis Veber's 1998 comedy Le Dîner de Cons for which he won the César Award for best supporting actor.

Wojciech Pszoniak (born in 1942 in Lwów, currently Ukraine), is a Polish film and theater actor.

Pszoniak gained international visibility following Andrzej Wajda's 1975 film The Promised Land, in which he played Moritz, one of the three main characters.

The actor left Poland during the period of political unrest in 1980-1981, which saw the appearance of the Solidarity trade union and ended with the imposition of martial law on December 13, 1981. Pszoniak found roles in France, where he is currently living and working. Since the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, Pszoniak has appeared in Polish movies and plays.

Internationally, he simplified his first name into Wojtek, which is the standard diminutive of the relatively formal Wojciech in the Polish language.

Pszoniak often plays Jewish characters, although he is not of Jewish descent. In France, this is partially attributable to his role in The Promised Land, as well as his foreign accent.

Pszoniak did not speak French when he emigrated to France, so he learned his theatrical lines phonetically; in movies like Danton, where he played Robespierre, his voice was dubbed. An anecdote about his language skills relates that when he finally started speaking French, one director told him that he preferred his old accent.

Ruggero Raimondi was born in Bologna, Italy, during World War II. His voice matured early into its adult timbre, and at the age of 15, he auditioned for conductor Francesco Molinari-Pradelli, who encouraged him to pursue an operatic career. He began vocal studies with Ettore Campogalliani, and was accepted at age 16 as a student at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan. He then continued his studies in Rome, under the guidance of Teresa Pediconi and Armando Piervenanzi.

After having won the National Competition for young opera singers in Spoleto, he made his debut in the same city in the role of Colline in La bohème in the Festival dei Due Mondi. Subsequently, an opportunity arose for him at the Teatro dell'Opera in Rome when he was called upon to substitute in the role of Procida in Giuseppe Verdi's I vespri siciliani, and he received enormous success from the public and the critics. The young singer was very shy and stiff at first, but his early directors helped him, and he was soon an accomplished opera actor.

Raimondi's career soon extended to the major opera houses in Italy, such as La Fenice in Venice, the Teatro Regio in Turin, Teatro Comunale in Florence and abroad, beginning with the Glyndebourne Festival (Don Giovanni in 1969). His La Scala debut was as Timur in Turandot in 1968, his Metropolitan Opera debut was as Silva in Ernani in 1970, and his Covent Garden debut was as Fiesco in Simon Boccanegra in 1972. In 1975, he made his Paris Opera debut as Procida, followed by the title role in Boris Godunov, and his Salzburg Festival debut in 1980 as the King in Aida. In 1986, he first directed a production of Don Giovanni, and decided to continue his career as a director as well.

Some of his most important roles have been King Philip in Verdi's Don Carlos; Fiesco; the title roles in Boris Godunov (including the Andrzej Żuławski film) and Attila; Silva; Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen (including the Francesco Rosi film, 1984, with Plácido Domingo and Julia Migenes); the title role in Don Giovanni (including the Joseph Losey film, 1979); Count Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro; and Don Alfonso in Così fan tutte; the title role in Don Quichotte by Massenet; and Scarpia in a recording of Tosca later filmed live from Rome, with Plácido Domingo and Catherine Malfitano, conducted by Zubin Mehta. He also made the television film Six Characters in Search of a Singer.[citation needed] In 2008, Raimondi made his television debut in the mini-series Le Sanglot des anges on French TV, in which he played the role of an Italian opera singer. In July 2011 he played the role of Pagano in Verdi's I Lombardi alla prima crociata on the rooftop of Milan Cathedral. The concert was organized by the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Italian unification.

He started out in film as an assistant and screenwriter collaborating with Louis Malle on Zazie dans le métro in 1960 and Vie privée in 1961. In 1964, he was co-screenwriter for L'Homme de Rio, which starred Jean-Paul Belmondo.

The first film that he both wrote and directed was A Matter of Resistance in 1965. Although it was a great critical and popular success, he did not make another film until 1971, when he directed Les Mariés de l'an II, again starring Belmondo and Marlène Jobert.

Since 1975, Rappeneau has written only for his own films, including Le Sauvage, starring Yves Montand and Tout feu, tout flamme (1981), again with Montand, who co-starred with Isabelle Adjani.

In 1990, Rappeneau directed a deluxe Technicolor film version of Cyrano de Bergerac, his adaptation of the classic French play by Edmond Rostand, starring Gérard Depardieu. Rappeneau's film version is the most elaborate film version of the play ever made, and one of the most expensive French films ever produced. It is the only rendition of the play in the original French to be released widely. At the 1991 César Awards, Rappeneau won the César Award for Best Director and César Award for Best Film.

The 2003 comedy Bon voyage, co-written with Patrick Modiano, again starred Depardieu, this time with Isabelle Adjani. The film was nominated 11 times at the 2004 César Awards.

Aurélien Recoing is the son of Alain Recoing (puppeteer), and the brother of Éloi Recoing (director and translator), Blaise Recoing (actor and musician), and David Recoing (pianist, composer).

Born in Paris on May 5, 1958, Aurélien Recoing began training to be an actor in 1974 at Cours Florent, and studied at Quartier d'Ivry. In 1977, the actor-in-training, who spoke fluent English and a little Russian, joined the Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique in Paris, where he studied under Jean-Pierre Miquel and Antoine Vitez. He has appeared in more than 30 plays and has directed stage performances of works by Thomas Bernhard, Fernando Pessoa and Paul Claudel. He was awarded the Prix Gérard Philipe in 1989.

In 1980, Aurélien Recoing took his first steps into the world of cinema, in Exploits of a Young Don Juan. Finding art-house cinema appealing to him, he worked with Philippe Garrel on Emergency Kisses (Les baisers de secours), and with Laurence Ferreira Barbosa on Modern Life. The actor rose to fame in 2001 thanks to Laurent Cantet's Time Out (L'Emploi du Temps), in which he plays a man who invents a false life to avoid having to tell his friends and family that he has been fired from his job. As he became more and more in demand, he alternated between blockbusters such as Ruby & Quentin and That Woman and art-house films like L'Ennemi naturel and Orlando Vargas. Lending his talents to a number of unusual projects, in 2006 he portrayed a gamblers in 13 Tzameti, Géla Babluani's black-and-white thriller, and also appeared in Forgive Me (Pardonnez-moi), Maïwenn's home-movie style drama. In the same year, the physically imposing actor found himself transported back to 1914 France in Fragments of Antonin, and then to 1959 Kabylia in Florent Emilio Siri's Intimate Enemies. In 2008, he starred in Franck Llopis' Paris Nord-Sud and in La Saison des Orphelins. The following year, he was cast in Gilles Béhat's crime thriller Diamant 13 with Gérard Depardieu, and in Denis Dercourt's Tomorrow at Dawn (Demain dès l'aube).

He has made appearances in The Horde, directed by Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher, Xavier de Choudens' Joseph and the Girl with Jacques Dutronc, and Léon Desclozeaux's Cargo, the Lost Men in 2010. He appeared in Frédéric Schoendoerffer's Switch, as well as in Olias Barco's Kill Me Please, which won the Marc'Aurelio d'Oro for best film at Rome Film Festival in 2010. He also appeared in Abdellatif Kechiche's Blue is the Warmest Colour, which took the Palme d'Or at Cannes. In 2020 he appeared in Adults in the room. An upcoming appearance is in Grand Ciel an Arte Film.

He made his first short film as a director The Rifleman (Un Bon Tireur) which won an Award Winner for Best Drama in 2021. He is developing his first feature film Naked Hands (À Mains Nues) with Sensito Films Productions.

In her 80 year career, she has appeared in 86 films and TV films, released 25 albums and 114 singles. She has also appeared in 12 plays and written or co-written approximately 20 books. In 2022, she played the titular character in the film Driving Madeleine.

Line Renaud was born in Pont-de-Nieppe on 2 July 1928. Her mother Simone was a shorthand typist; her father was a truck driver during the week but he played the trumpet, on weekends, in a local brass band. Line showed the first signs of her talent in primary school, when at the age of seven she won an amateur competition.

During the Second World War, Jacqueline's father was mobilised, spending five years away from the family. During this time, Jacqueline was brought up by her mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. Her grandmother had a café in Armentières, where she used to sing for passing soldiers.

She auditioned at Conservatoire de Lille, singing songs written by Louis ""Loulou"" Gasté ""Sainte-Madeleine"" and ""Mon âme au diable"", a well-known French composer. At the end of the audition, she was approached by the director of Radio Lille who was looking for a singer. She took the pseudonym of Jacqueline Ray and joined the station singing a repertoire based on the songs by Loulou Gasté.

Line Renaud made her national debut on Radio Luxembourg, singing on a Sunday morning program. After signing a contract with Pathe Marconi, she recorded ""Ma Cabane au Canada"", written by Loulou Gasté, which won le Grand Prix du Disque. She also sang with Yves Montand in the Théâtre de l'Etoile. She toured Europe and Africa extensively, came back to Paris to star at the ABC, and recorded numerous adaptations of American songs such as ""Ma petite folie"", ""Étoile des neiges"" and ""Le Chien dans la vitrine"".

During this trip, she also sang in the Waldorf Astoria (New York) and the Cocoanut Grove (Los Angeles), appeared on Johnny Carson, Dinah Shore and Ed Sullivan shows and recorded with Dean Martin the songs ""Relax-Ay-Voo"" and ""Two Sleepy People"".

In 1966 she returned to Paris and the Casino de Paris starring in a new show, Desir de Paris. In 1968, she returned to Las Vegas for a number of performances.

As a film director and actor, he made more than forty films from the silent era to the end of the 1960s. As an author, he wrote the definitive biography of his father, the painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Renoir, My Father (1962).

In the 1930s, Renoir was associated with the Popular Front, and several of his films reflect the movement's left-wing politics and deal with social issues as well as class disparities. He was perhaps the most significant director of the poetic realism movement. The satirical comedy-drama film The Rules of the Game (1939) is often cited by critics as among the greatest films ever made; it is the only film to earn a place among the top ten films in the respected British Film Institute's Sight & Sound decennial critics' poll for every decade from the poll's inception in 1952 through the 2012 list. Other important works are Grand Illusion (1937), A Day in the Country (1946) and The River (1951).

His real name was Pierre Alphonse Léon Frédéric Bouclet. On 14 August 1930, he married Ferdinande Alice Andrée Bouclet in Lille.

He is famous in France for his unique comic talent. He used to simulate stuttering while talking, in a humoristic way, trying to pronounce some words and finally replacing them by others. In a famous French sketch, ""Les crêpes"", he explained the recipe that way, with sentences like this one: ""Then you add some mamerlade, oh sorry ! Some marlamade... Uh! Me, I pour some chocolate"".

Pierre Repp appeared in many theatre plays and TV shows, but mainly in music-hall and cabarets in Paris or on tour. Pierre Repp has his place in the French cinéma story due to many ""third-roles"" in about forty films.

After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s, he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog (1955), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps.

Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour (1959), Last Year at Marienbad (1961), and Muriel (1963), all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past. These films were contemporary with, and associated with, the French New Wave (la nouvelle vague), though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement. He had closer links to the ""Left Bank"" group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics. He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jorge Semprún and Jacques Sternberg.

In later films, Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms, including theatre, music, and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song.

His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness, memory, and the imagination, and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives. Throughout his career, he won many awards from international film festivals and academies.

He was, along with Nathalie Sarraute, Michel Butor and Claude Simon, one of the figures most associated with the Nouveau Roman (new novel) trend. Alain Robbe-Grillet was elected a member of the Académie française on March 25, 2004, succeeding Maurice Rheims at seat No. 32. He was married to Catherine Robbe-Grillet (née Rstakian).

Robbe-Grillet's career as a creator of fiction was not restricted to the writing of novels. For him, creating fiction in the form of films was of equal importance. His film career began when Alain Resnais chose to collaborate with him on his 1961 film Last Year at Marienbad. The film was nominated for the 1963 Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay and won the Golden Lion when it came out in 1961. In the credits it was presented as a film equally co-authored by Alain Robbe-Grillet and Alain Resnais.

Robbe-Grillet then went on to launch a career as a writer-director of a series of cerebral and often sexually provocative feature films which explored similar themes to those in his literary work (e.g. Voyeurism, The Body as Text, The 'Double'). He commenced with L'Immortelle (The Immortal One) (1962) which won the much-coveted Louis Delluc Prize of 1962. This was followed by his most commercially successful film after Last Year at Marienbad: Trans-Europ-Express (1966) starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, who continued to work with Robbe-Grillet on his next four films: his French-Slovak film L'homme qui ment/Muž, ktorý luže (The Man Who Lies) (1968), L'Eden et après/Eden a potom (Eden and After) (1970), Glissements progressifs du plaisir (Progressive Slidings towards Pleasure) (1974) and Le jeu avec le feu (Playing with Fire) (1975). It was almost a decade before the appearance of his next feature film, La belle captive (The Beautiful Captive) (1983), but Alain Robbe-Grillet was fortunate enough to enlist the services of Henri Alekan as cinematographer, the visionary master of cinematography for the films of Jean Cocteau. Subsequently more than a decade passed before Alain Robbe-Grillet got behind the lens again, this time filming a mystery thriller on a small Greek island with Fred Ward starring as the confused Frank in Un bruit qui rend fou. Robbe-Grillet (A Maddening Noise, aka: The Blue Villa) (1995). Before his death in 2008 Robbe-Grillet was to direct one more film, Gradiva (C'est Gradiva qui vous appelle) (2006) which brought once more to the fore his preoccupation with sadism and bondage in his fiction. Perhaps the best introduction to the film works of Alain Robbe-Grillet is the volume The Erotic Dream Machine by Professors Roch C.Smith and Anthony N. Fragola. Also of great value is the volume In the Temple of Dreams: The Writer on the Screen in which Robbe-Grillet himself explains the relationship between his literary fiction and his cinematic fiction (ed. Edouard d'Araille, 1996).",1922-08-18,2008-02-18,34590.0,Writing,"Brest, Finistère, France",0.8359,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//jB27kZvaivRtvStVzbl594ZrWJb.jpg

During the Occupation of France, she had a prominent role in Love Story and Summer Light (both 1943), and The Bellman (1945).

Rochefort was born in Paris, France. He was educated at the Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen He was 19 years old when he entered the Centre d'Art Dramatique de la rue Blanche. Later he joined the Conservatoire National. After his national service, in 1953, he worked with the Compagnie Grenier Hussenot as a theatre actor for seven years. There he was noticed for his ability to play both drama and comedy. He then became a television and cinema actor. He has also worked as director.

In his 30s during the shooting of Cartouche, he discovered his passion for horses and equestrianism. He has been a horse breeder since then and now owns Le Haras de Villequoy. His passion led him to become a horse consultant for French television in 2004. He has won two César Awards: In 1976, Best Supporting Actor for Que la fête commence; and in 1978, Best Actor for Le Crabe-tambour.

He was to play the title character in The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, after being found as ""the perfect Quixote"" by director Terry Gilliam. Rochefort learned English just for the part. Unfortunately, amongst other production problems, he began suffering from a herniated disc. Unable to film for months, production was cancelled. A documentary, Lost in La Mancha, was made about the failed production. With recent news of the film's possible restart, Rochefort has been recast with Robert Duvall, due to his inability to ride a horse.

In 1960 he married Alexandra Moscwa, with whom he fathered two children: a girl, Marie (1962), and a boy, Julien (1965).

In 2007, he sang with the French band Dionysos a short verse in l'homme sans trucage: « Vas-y, saute, monte, grimpe à ton cœur, sauve-toi, n'aie pas peur, ouvre grand, mon petit, il est temps d'avaler une énorme bouffée d'air frais, andalucia, anda, anda, andalucia... » (Go ahead, jump, climbs to your heart, save yourself, don't be afraid, open wide, my boy, it's time to swallow a huge breath of fresh air, andalucia, anda, anda, andaluci...)

She went on to appear in over 100 movies in her career.

Rosay was born Françoise Bandy de Nalèche in Paris, the illegitimate daughter of Marie-Thérèse Chauvin, an actress known as Sylviac. She originally planned to become an opera singer, and in 1917, won a prize at the Paris Conservatoire and made her debut at the Palais Garnier in the title role of Salammbô by Ernest Reyer. She also sang in Castor et Pollux by Rameau and Thaïs by Massenet.

Her first recorded film was Falstaff in 1911, and she began to work in Hollywood from 1929 onwards. In 1917, she married the director Jacques Feyder, with whom she remained until his death in 1948, having three sons. She appeared in several films under her husband's direction, including Le Grand Jeu (1933), Pension Mimosas (1934), La Kermesse héroïque (Carnival in Flanders) (1935) and Les Gens du voyage (1937). Rosay spent the duration of World War II in England and Switzerland, where she taught acting classes at the Conservatoire de Genève. She still appeared in films during this time, notably the British Halfway House (1944) as the refugee French wife of a British sea captain.

During her career, she appeared with all the great stars of French cinema, including Jean Gabin, Michèle Morgan, Raimu, Jeanne Moreau, Danielle Darrieux, Micheline Presle, Paul Meurisse, Gérard Philipe, Louis Jouvet, Michel Simon, Simone Signoret, Fernandel and Jean-Louis Barrault. In Hollywood, she co-starred with Charles Boyer, Maurice Chevalier and Buster Keaton and worked with directors such as William Dieterle (September Affair, 1949), Martin Ritt (The Sound and the Fury, 1958), Ronald Neame (The Seventh Sin, 1956) and Peter Glenville (Me and the Colonel, 1957) with Danny Kaye. In England she appeared in The Alien Corn, a segment of the W. Somerset Maugham anthology film Quartet. A highly accomplished pianist herself in real life, she played the role of a famous piano virtuoso who gives aspiring pianist Dirk Bogarde a compassionate but honest and devastating critical appraisal of his likelihood of becoming a great musician – which results in his suicide. She performs in the film Schubert's Impromptu in E flat.

In 1950 she appeared on stage at London's Winter Garden Theatre, playing the title role in 'Madame Tic Tac' but it had only a short run.

It was not until 1938 that her biological father, Count François Louis Bandy de Nalèche, acknowledged her as his daughter.

Her final appearance on film was in the Maximilian Schell-directed Academy Award-nominated and Golden Globe-winner for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film of 1974, Der Fußgänger (English title: The Pedestrian).

She died in Montgeron, Île-de-France, near Paris. Her grave is located in Sorel-Moussel, Île-de-France, where she is buried with her husband, movie director Jacques Feyder. They had three sons.

There are streets named after Françoise Rosay in Limoges, Montpellier, Chevry-Cossigny, Launaguet and Martigues.

He appeared for the first time in cinema in 1976 in The Judge and the Assassin by Bertrand Tavernier in a small role as a guard.

In the early 1980s, he played on the boards of the Café-Théâtre des Blancs-Manteaux and began to be spotted by certain critics for the excellence of his playing, 'remarkably expressive'. Thereafter, he interpreted many small roles before the public noticed him in Génial, mes parents divorcent!, a success of Patrick Braoudé in 1990, director whom he will find for Neuf mois in 1994. With this resurgence of popularity, he chained roles with Bertrand Tavernier, Étienne Chatiliez or Gérard Oury.

The collaboration with Laurent Baffie will be fruitful in the theater: Sex, Shenanigans and General Culture, Toc toc and in the play Jacques Daniel with Claude Brasseur.

On television, his performances in On the Edge or in Suzie Berton are noticed. He plays in the series Trois pères à la maison on M6 and La vie est à nous. Then he played Pierre Bérégovoy in the TV movie A Man of Honor in 2009.

She dubbed herself the ""Queen of the Night"".

Rachelle Zylberberg was born in Anderlecht, Belgium, to Polish Jewish parents, Joseph Zylberberg and Tauba Rodstein. She spent much of her early life in hiding from the Nazis in occupied wartime France. Abandoned in infancy by her unwed mother who moved to Argentina, she was 12 when her father was arrested by the Nazis. She hid in a convent, where she was reportedly beaten. After the war, she sold bras in the streets of Paris. Her father, Joseph, managed to survive the war. He opened a cafe in Paris's Belleville neighborhood.

Known as Régine, she became a torch singer, by 1953, she was a nightclub manager in Paris. She is attributed with the invention of the modern-day discothèque, by virtue of creating a new dynamic atmosphere at Paris' Whisky à Gogo, with the ubiquitous jukebox replaced by disc jockeys utilising linked turntables.

In 1957, she opened Chez Régine in the Latin Quarter, which became the place to be seen for visiting celebrities, socialites and royalty. As Zylberberg's celebrity expanded she established other venues under the name Chez Régine's in London, New York City, Monte Carlo and elsewhere. These were ultra-selective venues in prime urban locations, all featuring her signature ""disco-style"" layout. Zylberberg's Paris Whisky à Gogo became the inspiration for the later establishment of the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in Los Angeles.] She also established Jimmy'z, a nightclub in Monaco, in 1974.

In the 1970s, Zylberberg moved to New York and lived in a suite of the Delmonico Hotel where she opened one of her clubs on the ground floor of the hotel. The club served food under the direction of French chef Michel Guérard. In the 1970s, she designed a line of ""Ready-to-Dance"" evening clothes which were proof against wrinkling and so could be packed, which were sold at Bloomingdale's. In 1988, she was in charge of the Ledoyen Restaurant on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.

On 22 April 1996, Zylberberg and her son were arrested for refusing to comply with crew requests and smoking on an American Airlines flight. It was alleged that, though she was travelling economy, Régine had demanded a first-class upgrade, which the airline declined. In June 2011, she appeared as Solange in Follies at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. She lived with her husband in Saint-Tropez.

She had one son, Lionel, from her first husband Leon Rothcage, whom she married when she was 16.

Zylberberg died on 1 May 2022, according to her granddaughter.

He was born in Rouen, but spent most of his childhood at Le Havre, and moved to Paris in 1917. His first works show the influence of the Surrealists.

He was the owner of a profitable advertising firm, but sold it in order to devote his time to writing plays. Encouraged by Charles Dullin, he wrote in a wide range of styles and enjoyed great success from the mid-1930s. His later work is usually grouped with that of the Existentialists. He flirted with communism during the 1920s and criticized capitalism in his play Boulevard Durand. During the Nazi occupation of France, he participated in the clandestine French resistance, an experience which he celebrated in Les Nuits de la colère.

He was a member of the Académie Goncourt, and a library in his home town is named after him.

During her career she worked closely with Jean-Luc Godard and Jacques Rivette in addition to Truffaut, latterly on the scripts of his films.

His plays have been staged in over fifty countries all over the world.

Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt's parents were teachers of physical education and sport, and his father later became a physiotherapist and masseur in paediatric hospitals. He was also a French boxing champion while his mother was a medal-winning runner. His grandfather was an artisan jeweller.

The ""Classiques & Contemporains"" edition of La Nuit de Valognes (Don Juan on Trial) claims that Schmitt depicts himself as a rebellious teenager who detested received wisdom and was sometimes prone to violent outbursts. According to Schmitt, however, it was philosophy that saved him and taught him to be himself and to feel that he was free. One day, his mother took him to the Théâtre des Célestins to see a performance of Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac starring Jean Marais. Her son was moved to tears and the seeds of his passion for the theatre were sown. After the show, he told his mother that he wanted to ""be like the man on the poster""; his mother thought he meant the actor, Jean Marais, but he replied: ""No!"" and read out the name on the poster ""Edmond Rostand"". He then began to write. Later, he would say: ""At sixteen, I realised (or decided) that I was a writer, and I wrote, produced and acted in my first plays at high school."" To improve his style, he threw himself with frenzied zeal into exercises of pastiche and re-writing, especially Molière.

After preparatory classes at the Lycée du Parc for France's elite universities, Schmitt passed the entrance exam to the École normale supérieure. He was a student there between 1980 and 1985, leaving with the top French teaching qualification in philosophy (agrégé de philosophie). In 1987, he was awarded the degree of PhD for his thesis ""Diderot and Metaphysics"" at the Paris-Sorbonne University, which was published in 1997 with the title ""Diderot or the Philosophy of Seduction"".

He has lived in Brussels since 2002 and obtained Belgian citizenship in 2008.

Schmitt spent his military service teaching at the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, afterwards spending two years as a student teaching assistant at the University of Besançon. He went on to teach at the high school in Cherbourg before being appointed lecturer at the University of Chambéry, where he taught for four years.

On the night of 4 February 1989, he became separated from his companions during an expedition to the Ahaggar Desert and, in the vast expanses of the Sahara, he underwent a spiritual experience that was nothing short of a divine revelation. In that instant, he says that his mind was filled with the words ""Everything is justified"". Schmitt believes that it was that extraordinary experience that enabled him to break into writing. He describes it in his novel Night of Fire (La Nuit de Feu), published in September 2015. ...

Élie Semoun was born in France, to a Sephardic Jewish family of Moroccan-Jewish and Algerian-Jewish descent. In 1980 at the age of 17, Semoun wrote two collections of poems and two plays. Beginning in 1988, he had regular appearances on the television series Vivement lundi! on TF1, where he played a horse mounted on rollers.

His comedy career began in 1990 with his partner Dieudonné M'bala M'bala, with whom he wrote and performed daring, skits with scathing takes generally taboo subjects such as racism and poverty, often playing up contrasts between himself and his partner in terms of origin, color, and religion.

Their first show was held at Café de la Gare in 1991. The duo acquired a certain notoriety in 1992 after several appearances on their fellow comedian Arthur's show Emission Impossible, where they were noticed for their particularly corrosive sketches. They followed this up with one success after another at Le Splendid Theater, Paris's Palais des glaces, and at Casino de Paris. Élie and Dieudonné formed one of the most popular comic duos of the 1990s.

In 1997 the duo split due to artistic and financial differences. Élie resented how Dieudonné handled their relations with the media and admitted that he was unhappy that his friend had turned towards film (and that he left to appear in the United States) and antisemitism. Dieudonné managed the financial aspects of their career, and Semoun felt their money was not divided equitably.

Breaking out on his own, Semoun continued his success with Petites Annonces d'Élie (which had been at first intended to be a show with Dieudonné) alongside his friend the actor Franck Dubosc. Once again his performance was promoted by his friend on the show Les Enfants de la télé (France) Inspired by actual classified ads recorded by them in a van, the ""Petites Annonces d'Élie"" (Élie's Classified Ads) are seen through the character of Cyprian, a repulsive looking man searching for a ""busty blond"".

Semoun went back on stage with a one-man show, Élie and Semoun. He supported Bertrand Delanoë during Paris's municipal elections of 2001 and Lionel Jospin during the presidential election of 2002. In 2003, he released an album of French songs called simply ""Chansons"". In early 2005, he performed in a show (co-authored with Franck Dubosc and Muriel Robin entitled Élie Semoun se prend pour qui?

Élie Semoun maintained in the years following his separation with Dieudonné a complex and strained relationship with his former partner. First strained, then reconciled, they have again grown apart during the public controversy aroused by the political stances of Dieudonné. ""Some have speculated on the reunion of our duo, but I must tell you that this is clearly out of the question! It's over."" In 2012, he declared that ""the Dieudonné he knew and the Dieudonné of today appear to him like two completely different people, and he is unable to reconcile them in his mind"". ...

Since 1952, he has appeared in more than 120 films. These include seven films that have been screened at the Cannes Film Festival.

He was born to Béla Szabó and Margit Gulyás.

Between 1954-1956 he was a student at the Budapest University of Technology , during which he performed in an amateur theater group. He applied to the Theater and Film Academy as an actor, but was not accepted. He left the country in the fall of 1956 and went to Paris .

Like the French new wavers, he also visited Henri Langlois ' ""liberty university of film history"" at the Cinématheque, watched the film series, met and talked to the directors who presented their films, and while writing in the ""cahiers"", interviewed Buster Keaton together with Jacques Rivette . He and a friend dropped by on the set of Chabrol (Cousins), from whom he immediately received a one-sentence role. And in his next film, Locked with the Key , a longer one. After that, Godard gave him the role of the interrogator in The Little Soldier , which was followed by other roles in more recent Godard films.

He is the favorite character actor of all the directors of the new wave, everyone has a role for him, they entrust him with strange, boho characters, who always have some disturbing and annoying ulterior motives.

He also took a liking to directing, and made two new-wave French films. Truffaut wrote an appreciative review of the amusing film noir The White Gloves of the Devil . Zig-Zig was played by the new wave's favorite anti-star actress, Bernadette Lafont , and a cool star, Catherine Deneuve . This is also where the self-confidence and sardonic pungency of the new wavers can be felt. Like all actor-directors, he brought out the best in his actresses, skillfully mixing dark humor and tenderness.

In the meantime, from the end of the 1960s he appeared in Hungarian films, and after many character roles, he got the lead role from Zsolt Kézdi-Kovács : Miklós Dibusz, the big snooty, sumák organizer, The nice neighbor .

He was a famous cinematographer of volcanic eruptions and lava flows, and the author of several books on volcanoes. He was also a government adviser and French cabinet minister. He also served in the Belgian resistance during world war 2.

His parents met and married in 1906 while they were both students in Brussels. They later returned to Warsaw, Russian Partition, where their first son, Salvator, died at two months and where Haroun was born. His father, Sabir, was a Muslim medical doctor, of Tatar descent and his mother, Zenita Iliyasovna Klupta, was a Tatar[dubious – discuss] chemist and doctor of natural science and holder of a bachelor's degree in political science. His father was conscripted into the Russian Army and died during the First world war, a fact that did not reach the family until 1919. In 1917 Haroun emigrated to Brussels with his widowed mother.

Haroun received a degree in agronomy in Gembloux in 1938, and another degree in geology at the University of Liège in 1944. He was later a Secretary of state in France, in charge of protection against major risks.

Haroun Tazieff participated in the first detailed exploration of the ""Saint-Martin"" La Verna cave system in the French Pyrenees. In 1952, while he was filming Marcel Loubens' ascent of the Pierre-Saint-Martin rock face, the cable of the hoist broke and Loubens fell over 80 meters. Loubens died 36 hours later but his body could only be recovered from the cave in 1954.

He became famous in France after publishing a book entitled, ""Le Gouffre de la Pierre Saint-Martin"" in 1952.

He directed the documentary movie Le volcan interdit (1966) about the Nyiragongo Mountain in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which he was the first to climb in 1948.

The National Geographic film, The Violent Earth, was based on Tazieff's expeditions to the volcanoes Mount Etna on Sicily in 1971 and Mount Nyiragongo in 1972. In these expeditions he attempted, unsuccessfully, to descend into the active lava lake in order to collect samples — something he had managed to achieve on a previous expedition in 1959.

Tazieff died in 1998 and was buried in the Passy Cemetery in Paris.

As a writer, almost from the beginning, he was fascinated by a curious genre that he helped invent: the comédie policière or comedy thriller, of which Eight Women is an example. In 1960, Thomas had a hit with Man Trap, a humorous murder mystery which was an overnight success in Paris. Alfred Hitchcock bought the rights and the play established Thomas as a writer of psychological crime dramas with a distinctively Gallic comic twist. The following year the second outing of Eight Women was far more successful as it won the Hachette Prix du Quai des Orfevres for Best Play in 1961.

Thomas was a prolific actor, playwright and movie director. If he is best known for Eight Women it is probably because it was adapted into a movie musical by François Ozon in 2002 with a star-studded line-up that included Catherine Deneuve, Fanny Ardant and Emmanuelle Béart. Thomas’s plays were never fashionable and he was often dismissed by French critics but he was a popular dramatist. By the time he was 18, he claimed he had read every play published in French since 1900.

Thomas died in 1989 in Paris.

The next year, he played a theater role in Pericles, Prince of Tyre before joining the Branquignols troupe of Robert Dhéry, which also included Jean Lefebvre, Michel Serrault and Micheline Dax.

Because of his tall and imposing stature, he often appeared as a policeman or a soldier. His most famous roles were the father's victim in The Common Man (1975), Captain Dumont in the series Now Where Did the 7th Company Get to? (1973) and commissioner Florimond Faroux in the series Nestor Burma.

Nicknamed “il principe della risata’ (the prince of laughter), he was an Italian comedian, film and theatre actor, writer, singer and songwriter, and widely considered one of the greatest Italian artists of the 20th century.  While he first gained his popularity as a comic actor, his dramatic roles, poetry, and songs are all of cultural import; his style and a number of his recurring jokes and gestures have become universally known memes in Italy.

As a comic actor, Totò is classified as an heir of the Commedia dell'Arte tradition, and has been compared to such figures as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.  At the age of 15, he was already acting as a comedian in small theatres, under the pseudonym ""Clerment"". His early repertoire mostly consisted in imitations of Gustavo De Marco's characters. He served in the army during World War I and then went back to acting to develop the trademarks of his style.   

In 1937, he appeared in his first movie ""Fermo con le mani"", and later starred in 96 more films, many of which are still frequently broadcast on Italian television. In his vast cinematographic career, Totò had the opportunity to act side by side with virtually all major Italian actors of the time. Totò's unmistakable figure, with his peculiarly irregular face (due to an accident in his teen years), and his unique trademark ability to disarticulate his body like a marionette, soon became very popular and his comic gags became part of the Italian culture. Totò died at the age of 69 in Rome after a series of heart attacks. Due to overwhelming popularity there were three funeral services: the first in Rome, and the second and third in Naples.

Elisa Tovati was born in 1976 to parents of Russo-Moroccan Jewish origins in Paris, France. She showed interest in theatre early in her life, and her teenage years saw her co-presenting a French programme Y'a pas d'lézard. Her co-star was Stéphane Tapie.

As the years went on, she featured in many telefilms such as Navarro, Highlander and Extrême Limite. Her singing career was to evolve as she was spotted during Roger Hanin's Soleil and the more crucial La Vérité si je men ! 2 (2001) where she played the girlfriend of José Garcia.

In 2007 she starred in 99 Francs featuring Jean Dujardin and Vahina Giocante.

In late 2014 she became a contestant on the fifth season of TF1's Danse avec les Stars.

Her singing career began on the same year her last film hit the big screen. She compiled her first album whose name comes from her first ever song and single, making it to the Top 50 in the French Charts, Moi, je t'aime pour rien. Her 2002 album, Ange Étrange was made possible by others in the music industry, namely: Rick Allison, Richard Seff, Patrick Bruel, Yaël Benzaquen and fellow musician Axelle Renoir. In 2011, she released her first album in six years Le syndrome de Peter Pan.

In 2006, Tovati married Universal music producer Sébastien Saussez. The couple has two sons.

During his career, he won a Molière Award in 1988 and received a César Award nomination in 2009.

Son of a Belgian army officer, Pierre Vaneck spent his youth in Antwerp, Belgium, until the age of 17, when he started medical studies in Paris, France. Before long, he branched into studying acting, first at the Rene Simon school, and then at the Theatre Academy, under Henri Rollan. He earned his living meanwhile by working for a saddle-maker by day, and in the evenings, he recited François Villon's poems in cabarets. His début on the stage came in 1952 in The Three Musketeers in the role of Louis XIII. His first important role in the cinema was in the Julien Duvivier film, Marianne of my Youth in 1955.

Pierre Vaneck was primarily a theatre and television actor. The general public knew him particularly for his television role as the father of the main character in Fabien Cosma, as well as in many other serials (Spring Tides, The Garonne...). Vaneck died on Sunday 31 January 2010, during open-heart surgery. He was married to Sophie Becker, daughter and sister of Jacques Becker and Jean Becker. His grandchildren, Aurélie and Thibaud Vaneck, are both actors, and feature in the television series Plus Belle la Vie which is broadcast on France 3 channel.

She is known as one of the most productive and tough-sounding yé-yé artists. Her performances often featured elaborate show-dance choreography,[and she made many appearances on French and Italian TV.

Yearly shows with then-husband Johnny Hallyday attracted full houses at the Olympia and the Palais des congrès de Paris throughout the 1960s and mid-1970s. In 2004, after a break in performances, she began recording and giving concerts of jazz ballads in francophone countries.

Sylvie Vartan was born in Iskrets, Sofia Province, in the then Kingdom of Bulgaria. Her father, Georges Vartanian (1912–1970), was born in France to a Bulgarian mother named Slavka and an Armenian father. He worked as an attaché at the French embassy in Sofia. The family shortened the name Vartanian to Vartan. Her mother, Ilona (née Mayer 1914–2007), daughter of prominent architect Rudolf Mayer, was of Hungarian-Jewish descent.

When the Soviet Army invaded Bulgaria in September 1944, the Vartanian family house was nationalised and they moved to Sofia. In 1952, a friend of Sylvie's father, film director Dako Dakovski, offered her the role of a schoolgirl in the movie Pod igoto, a film about Bulgarian rebels against the Ottoman occupation. Participating in the film made her dream of becoming an entertainer come true.

The hardships of postwar Bulgaria made the family emigrate to Paris in December 1952. At first they stayed in the Lion d'Argent hotel near Les Halles, where Georges found a job, then for the next four years they stayed in a single room at the Angleterre Hotel. Young Sylvie had to work hard to keep up at school and blend in with her schoolmates. She spent two years learning French.

In 1960, her family moved to an apartment in Michel Bizot Avenue. Thanks to the influence of her music producer brother Eddie, music became teenage Sylvie's main interest. Her most influential genres were jazz and, out of spite toward her strict high school, rock 'n' roll. Her favourite artists included Brenda Lee, Bill Haley, and Elvis Presley.

In 1961, Eddie offered Sylvie the chance to record the song ""Panne d'essence"" with French rocker Frankie Jordan. The Decca Records EP was a surprise hit.

During his career, he earned many awards including the prestigious medal and title of Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.

Villeret was born Jacky Boufroura in Loches, Indre-et-Loire, France, to an Algerian father and a French mother. He studied at the Conservatoire de Paris (CNSAD) in the same class as Louis Seigner, the grandfather of Emmanuelle Seigner and Mathilde Seigner. While he was most famous for his role as François Pignon in Le Dîner de Cons; both on the stage and in the film, his other celebrated roles included the extra terrestrial in La soupe aux choux, the autistic Mo in L'été en pente douce, and marshal Ludwig von Apfelstrudel in Papy fait de la résistance.

At the time of making the film Un aller simple directed by Laurent Heynemann – a film about integration and racism and the clash of generations – he said that watching the young actors in the film, Barbara Schulz and Lorant Deutsch, reminded him of the insouciance he had had as a young man with his friends at the Conservatoire.

When his career was at its height, with the success of Le Dîner de Cons, everything collapsed in a tragedy mirroring the plot of the film. Villeret separated from his wife and suffered an enormous financial downfall due to tax issues, plunging him into depression. Villeret turned to alcohol for comfort, and became an alcoholic. He isolated himself and hid away for long periods. He later said: Alcohol is a friend, but a friend who means you harm.

Villeret's love of his profession helped to bring his career back from the brink. In an interview in 2001 he spoke of his admiration for performers like Johnny Hallyday and Jacques Brel for their level of commitment, and quoted the author Louis-Ferdinand Céline: When I write, I put my balls on the table.

In 1979 Villeret married Irina Tarassov, an actress and writer. They separated in 1998. Tassarov wrote about their life together in her book Un jour, tout ira bien. (One day, everything will go well).

In 2002 Villeret met Seny, a Senegalese-French widow descended through her grandfather, Mor Diarra N'Dao, from a long line of Sérès nobles of the ancient Kingdom of Saloum, and they fell instantly and deeply in love. They were partners for three years, and she was about to move to Paris to be with him when he died in Évreux in January 2005 of a liver haemorrhage. Seny wrote a memoir of their life together, Jacques Villeret, mon bébé blanc, which was published in Paris by Le Cherche Midi in 2005.

Gila von Weitershausen became popular in the late 1960s when she appeared in German comedy films, for example alongside Uschi Glas. One of the films from that period about Swinging Sixties Bavaria, Engelchen, gave her the nickname Engelchen (""Little Angel""), which was used by the tabloid press for decades. In one of her best-known roles, she played a prostitute in the 1971 film Murmur of the Heart. She also appeared several times as ""Rowena"" in the British TV series Arthur of the Britons. By common consensus one of her best performances was in Circle of Deceit (1981), a film directed by Volker Schlöndorff, where she played with Hanna Schygulla and Bruno Ganz. Von Weitershausen regularly appears in television movies to this day.

She was married to fellow actor Martin Lüttge from 1966 until 1972. Between 1970 and 1973, she had a relationship with movie director Louis Malle, who is the father of her son, Manuel Cuotemoc (born 1971). Since 1994, she has been married to Hartmut Wahle.

Youn was born Michaël Benayoun in Suresnes, France, to a family of Hungarian, Italian, Moroccan-Jewish, and Algerian-Jewish descent.

After his education as an announcer and theater actor, Youn joined the Paris radio station Skyrock in 1998. There, he made sketches and further entertainment during the morning show.

The popularity and success of Michael Youn, at the most important French private broadcast station brought Youn to the attention of French TV executives. In July 2000, he was hired for the new morning show ""Morning Live"" shown on Métropole 6. With Vincent Desagnat and Benjamin Morgaine, Youn did the entertainment part of the show. Like their sketches and public events (e.g. foam bath in a Paris fountain, and waking random Parisians up shooting the slogan of the show at them), their parodies were particularly successful. In particular, they parodied the music scene of Jean-Michel Jarre, casting-popstars, the Grand Prix and French rappers.

The success of ""Morning Live"" was mainly due to Youn and his colleagues – when they left the show, it remained on the air for just one more year.

After leaving ""Morning Live"" in 2002, Youn, Desagnat and Morgaine have focused on their music parodies: The three sailors ""Piotr"", ""Olaff"" and ""Dvorjak"" from the Eastern European ""Slowakistan"", the Bratisla Boys, appeared on the Western music market with their song ""Stach Stach"". The act became a big success and was number one on the French charts for ten weeks. On a 2004 list of the all-time best selling CDs in France, ""Stach Stach"" was listed number 30. The success even spread beyond the French border and reached Switzerland, where it was 2nd on the official charts. On 7 July 2002, the project was stopped by its makers. They claimed that the Bratisla Boys had vanished on the Dead Sea without a trace.

In 2003, the film ""La Beuze"", written by Youn and Desagnat, was released. Youn played the character of Alphonse, the ""unknown son"" of James Brown, who tries to start his own career – by creating a new (fictional) style called ""Frunkp"" (a mixture of funk and rap). The song ""Le Frunkp"" was published as a CD-single and Michaël Youn (under the name of Alphonse Brown) had another hit. This time, he even reached #1 in Swiss charts.

Youn had a comedy-tour, called Pluskapoil in 2003/04 (its sequel followed in 2005) and has acted in films. New music projects followed: Les Conards (The Imbeciles) with Comme des Connards, a cover version of My Sharona by The Knack, as well as a song for the movie Iznogoud (both were in the French Top 20). He had small roles in rather big films, and was part of Les 11 commandements in 2004 (A French film done in the style of MTV's Jackass, together with Desagnat and Morgaine).

In 2005, Youn was Iznogoud in the film version of the comic ""Iznogoud"" (also known as Isnogud). In 2006, he had the main role in the film comedy Incontrôlable. Those two films were not very successful, critics and viewers finding them only so-so. Both films starred Desagnat and Morgaine, but only in small roles.

In 2010, he directed his first movie ""Fatal"" in which he also stars. ...

He is the author of ten novels and the recipient of several literary prizes. He has directed three films. He was a columnist on On n'est pas couché.

Yann Moix was born on 31 March 1968 in Nevers, France. He earned a bachelor's degree in Philosophy from the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne and graduated from the École supérieure de commerce de Reims. He subsequently graduated from Sciences Po.

Moix is the author of several novels. He won the Prix Goncourt du premier roman, as well as the Prix François Mauriac from the Académie Française, for Jubilations vers le ciel in 1996. In 2013, he won the Prix Renaudot for Naissance.

Moix has directed three films, including Podium, which is based on one of his novels. Between 2015 and 2018, Moix was a panellist on On n'est pas couché, a television program. He also writes for the magazine La Règle du Jeu.

In 2009, Moix signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

In 2010, Moix signed a petition against the Gayssot Act created by his friend and Holocaust denier Paul-Éric Blanrue, stating that Robert Faurisson and Serge Thion were ""serious, intelligent, though delirious revisionists"".

In January 2019, Moix's comments about women over the age of 50 caused outrage on social media in France. In an interview with the French edition of the women's magazine Marie Claire, Moix declared that women in their 50s were “invisible” to him and that he preferred ""younger women's bodies."" He added that he preferred dating Asian women, particularly if they are Korean, Chinese or Japanese.

In August 2019, his novel Orléans was published to critical acclaim, but it left critics and the public bewildered about the revelations it contained. The book, despite being presented as a novel, is made to look heavily autobiographical, which lead the public to think that Yann Moix actually endured as a young boy what the protagonist goes through. The book is laced with hate for the narrator's parents, with Moix positioning himself between the lines as a real-life long-suffering victim who finally dares to tell the truth. Following public protests by Moix's parents and younger brother, it was revealed that some of the severe incidents described in the book actually took place between him and his brother, who is not mentioned in the book, with Yann Moix as the tormentor, and that several of the situations depicted were in fact made up or ""heavily exaggerated"". His brother, Alexandre Moix, who is also a writer and film producer and whose first book Yann Moix had apparently tried to block the publication of on the grounds that ""there can only be one Moix, MOI!"" [him], told media that his elder brother ""prefers to serve his own ambition rather than the truth"". He also stated that his older brother should not be a flag-bearer for suffering children, since ""he doesn't care about other people's suffering"". ...

He is known as a specialist in nobility and royalty. He has been awarded honours by several nations, including the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (France), the Order of Grimaldi (Monaco), and the Order of the British Empire (United Kingdom).

His parents, Melita Schlanger and Louis Bern, were born to Polish parents of Jewish families who had emigrated to Switzerland and France, before WW2. He came out in the magazine Têtu in October 2009 and in the documentary ""Vie privée, vie publique"" (by Mireille Dumas), which aired on France 3 on 6 November 2009.

Stéphane De Groodt is the son of an engineer at Texaco and a housewife who takes care of handicapped children in foundations. Dyslexic, he has a chaotic scholarity, which already translates his wills to play comedy. He did not obtain any graduation and decided to become a comedian as well as a racing driver. His parents offered him a racing driver suit and a helmet.

He then went through several small jobs, including barman, journalist, marketing assistant, editor and advertiser, while entering little by little the field of the competition. He learned to become a comedian in the evening on stage while dedicating the weekends to auto racing.

While cooking meal to sell it at restaurants, Stéphane De Groodt paid the auto racing school of La Châtre near Châteauroux where he met the Belgian racing driver Eric van de Poele. He was a professional racing driver from 1985 to 2000, and rose to fame especially with Formula Renault, Formula 3000, Porsche Supercup at the 2001 Spa 24 Hours, and even at the BMW M1 Procar Championship in which he received the title of Champion of Belgium in BMW Compact Cup. In 2000, he left the auto racing competition to become a full-time comedian.

Stéphane De Groodt created the series File dans ta chambre, broadcast since 14 January 2002 on channels RTBF, Canal+ Belgique and France 2, and in which the texts are co-written by his wife Odile d'Oultremont. The series are small episodes in which he portrays Lucien, a totally uncultivated father attempting to answer the questions asked by his 10-year-old son Clovis about a definition or an expression. At the end of every episode, his son answers that he thought it meant something else, which is in fact the real sense of the definition or meaning of the expression. After that, the father does not believe his son and orders him to go to his room, which is the reference to the title of the series.

In September 2012, Stéphane De Groodt features every Sunday on the program Le Supplément on Canal+ with Maïtena Biraben, in which he presents a column of a few minutes titled Retour vers le futur. This column functions the same way than the one he presented until 2012 on the program La Matinale on Canal+ and also with Maïtena Biraben and Caroline Roux, where he talked about his meeting with famous characters with a humoristic tune and a mixture of word plays and puns. He also presented a courrier des téléspectateurs (French for ""mail of the viewers""), imaginary and funny. He pursued this column weekly on RTL with Stéphane Bern on the radio program À la bonne heure where he comments a fake mail of improbable auditors.

In September 2013, after having left RTL, he joined France Inter on the radio program Comme on nous parle with Pascale Clark every Thursday, where he presents a column of a few minutes titled Mes mails, in which he comments a number of fake E-mails of auditors addressed to France Inter and Pascale Clark. ...

Born in 1935, Jacques Serguine, pen name of Jacques Gouzerh, lived and worked in Avon near Fontainebleau. He was noticed very young by Jean Paulhan who published his first texts in La Nouvelle Revue française. In 1959, his first novel, Les Fils de Rois, inaugurated the series ""Le Chemin"" (Gallimard) directed by Georges Lambrichs, obtained the Prix Fénéon and missed the Prix Médicis by one vote behind Claude Mauriac. Assimilated to the literary movement of the Hussards, he will decline the invitation by political convictions. His fourth novel Mano l'Archange, although unanimously hailed by the critic whose first defender was Kleber Haedens, was banned from sale for ""harm to good morals"".

On the sidelines of a noted literary work and devoted to the sensual aspect of human relations, Jacques Serguine is also the author of the famous Cruelle Zélande and Éloge de la fessée (Folio Gallimard) which has been said to have given their letters of nobility to this erotic fantasy. He is also the author of the original screenplay of the film A Very Curious Girl by Nelly Kaplan.

She is known for her roles as Juliette Silverton/Eve in the NBC television series Grimm, and as Lois Lane in The CWArrowverse shows, including the television series Superman & Lois.

Tulloch was born in San Diego, California, and grew up in Spain, Uruguay, and Argentina. Tulloch goes by ""Bitsie"", which is not a contraction of her given name, Elizabeth, but a homage to her oddly-nicknamed grandfather, a World War II bomber pilot, who was also involved in the 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash.

When Tulloch began acting she was credited as ""Bitsie"" and continued to be until 2017 when she decided to start using Elizabeth instead, explaining: ""I still go by Bitsie. I still introduce myself as Bitsie to people I meet. But, it sort of worked when I was in my mid-20s and I was just starting acting. And now I'm in my mid-30s, and I felt like, for billing purposes, I wanted to go back to Elizabeth. I was doing a movie... and it actually hadn't even occurred to me. And the producer was, like, ""Hey, we noticed it's Elizabeth when we were filling out your legal papers. Is that the way you want billing?"" And I just thought about it, and I called my agent and my manager, and they were like, ""Yeah, you know, that's not a bad idea. You are older now. And Bitsie is, obviously, a very kind of cute name. It's cutesy."" So, that's really all it was about. It's not like I introduce myself as Elizabeth now. It's just for billing, going forward.""

Tulloch is of Scottish and Spanish ancestry.

Tulloch has stated her first language was Spanish although she no longer considers herself completely fluent. Her paternal grandmother's family is from Renfrewshire and her grandfather's family originated from the area around Kirkwall, both in Scotland. In an interview with BBC News, she reported that ""we think the first Tulloch came to the US around 1880 and the Kerrs came in the early 1900s. After returning to the U.S., she went to middle and high school in Bedford, New York. Tulloch graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University with a double major in English and American Literature and Visual and Environmental Studies.

Tulloch's first acting credit was as R2-D2's ""girlfriend"" in R2-D2: Beneath the Dome, a mockumentary produced by George Lucas telling the life story of the fictional robot R2-D2 from the Star Wars film series. She starred as ""Sally"" in the premiere of Sam Forman's play, Quarterlife, which opened at the Pico Playhouse in March 2006. The Los Angeles Times wrote, ""Superbly performed... the scene at the end of the play, between Sally (Bitsie Tulloch) and Jack (Clark Freeman), was heartbreaking and beautiful... The lead actress, Bitsie Tulloch, [was] absolutely brilliant.""

She was in Lakeview Terrace directed by Neil LaBute, opposite Samuel L. Jackson, Kerry Washington, and Patrick Wilson, and worked with Barbara Hershey on a film called Uncross the Stars. In the fall of 2009 she filmed the romantic comedy Losing Control. Tulloch voiced one of the characters, a wolf called Sweets, in Alpha and Omega, a 3-D computer animated film, which was released in September 2010. ...

After studying social sciences and communications, he worked as a creative in an advertisement agency.

He became a photographic reporter in 1992, doing missions for the UNESCO and travelling the world for the Gamma agency. In five years, he did thirty pieces in fifteen countries.

His career in journalism shaped a working method that he would later apply in his fictional works. His stories are preceded by extensive research, which allows him to write stories that are as close to reality as possible. This vision of cinema, a ""lived-in filmmaking"" of sorts, aims to create fictional stories that are as documented as possible. Often tragicomical, his films present stories that are inspired by reality, with often non-professional actors. The objective is to blur the frontier between our world and the fictional realm.

He applied this method for the first time in 1997, with his first comic script: Fox One – Armageddon. To create this comic series, he attended the Red Flag Air Force Exercise at the Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada, visited the Charles de Gaulle, Foch and Clemenceau aircraft carriers during high seas exercises, and visited French Air Force Bases. The Fox One series was translated in five languages and sold over 90 000 copies.

In 2002, he directed his first short film, Undercover, a seven-minute presentation which mixed cinema and a live show; it won multiple international awards. In it one can find one of his central themes: the blurred distinction between fiction and reality.

Ibrahimović is renowned for his acrobatic strikes and volleys, powerful long-range shots, and excellent technique and ball control. He is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time and is one of the most decorated active footballers in the world, having won 34 trophies in his career. He has scored over 570 career goals, including more than 500 club goals, and has scored in each of the last four decades.

Ibrahimović began his career at Malmö FF in 1999, and signed for Ajax two years later, where he gained a reputation as one of the most promising forwards in Europe. He departed two years later to sign for Juventus before joining domestic rivals Inter Milan in 2006, where he won three consecutive Serie A titles. In the summer of 2009, he moved to Barcelona in one of the world's most expensive transfers. After just one season, he returned to Italy having signed for Inter's rival Milan. With them, he won the Serie A title in his debut season. In 2012, Ibrahimović joined Paris Saint-Germain, leading them to their first Ligue 1 title in 19 years and soon establishing himself as a leading figure in their dominance of French football. During his four-season stay in France, he won four consecutive Ligue 1 titles, was the top scorer in Ligue 1 for three seasons and became PSG's all-time leading goalscorer at the time. In 2016, he joined Manchester United on a free transfer and won his first European honour in his debut season. Ibrahimović joined American club LA Galaxy in 2018 and rejoined Milan in 2020, winning his fifth Serie A title in 2022.

Ibrahimović is one of eleven players to have made 100 or more appearances for the Swedish national team, over a 20-year international career. He is the country's all-time leading goalscorer with 62 goals. He represented Sweden at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 UEFA European Championships. He has been awarded Guldbollen (the Golden Ball), given to the Swedish player of the year, a record 12 times, including 10 consecutive times from 2007 to 2016. Ibrahimović's 35-yard bicycle kick goal for Sweden against England won the 2013 FIFA Puskás Award, and is often considered one of the best goals of all time.

Ibrahimović was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI in 2013 and the UEFA Team of the Year in 2007, 2009, 2013 and 2014. He finished at a peak of fourth for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2013. In 2015, UEFA ranked him as the best player ever not to have won the UEFA Champions League, while in 2019, FourFourTwo magazine named him the third-greatest player never to win the competition. In December 2014, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter ranked him the second-greatest Swedish sportsperson ever, after tennis player Björn Borg.

The same year, he directed his first long film La Vie d'artiste, with Sandrine Kiberlain, Denis Podalydès and Émilie Dequenne in the lead rôles. This film won the Prix Michel-d'Ornano for the best work of French fiction at the Deauville American Film Festival.

As many of them he was influenced by Georges Brassens, Renaud, Jacques Higelin and also Tom Waits. His songs describe day-to-day life events with humour and a tender cynicism. His songs are influenced by French chanson and a heavy influence is placed on the piano or the accordion and on typical French fanfare (brass band) for the most upbeat of them. This genre of music is very typically French and differs from most in that emphasis is placed on appreciation of the lyrics and that it is linked to a specific culture of modern ""guinche"" (slang for ""guinguette"") appreciated a lot by Bobos among others.

Bénabar began his career in the cinema, working as an assistant on Le Brasier (1991) before directing three short subjects: Nada Lezard (1991), José Jeannette (1992) and Sursum corda (1994). He then turned to music, working for some time with his friend Patchol who gave him his nickname (Bénabar being the ""verlan"" of Barnabé, the name he was using on stage). With ""Les associés"" he sang for several years in small places in France, Belgium, and Switzerland before the release of Bénabar (2001), which raised his profile sufficiently to make him the opening act for Henri Salvador. He was nominated as a Revelation for the ""Victoires de la musique 2003"" but did not win it. In 2004, after the successful release of Les risques du métier, he won the award for ""album ""chanson/variété"" of the year"". His next album Reprise des négociations sold better than the previous ones: according to Le Figaro, Bénabar reached number 4 for CD sales in France, with 2.18 million euros sales in 2006. In 2007 he won the awards for ""Male group or artist of the year"" and ""original song of the year"" (for Le dîner).

He has two brothers named Patrick and Sébastien. He has a son born in 2004 named Manolo and a daughter born in 2009.

Bénabar is a member of the Les Enfoirés charity ensemble since 2007.

Aufray is known for French language covers of Bob Dylan's songs. Aufray knew Dylan and his work from his time in New York City, as well as from record shops, and his translations capture the rawness of the original songs. His most famous original songs are ""Santiano"", ""Céline"", ""Stewball"" and ""Hasta Luego"".

He was born to Henry Auffray, an industrialist and Amyelle de Caubios d'Andiran, (1898-1992) a musician, second cousin of the French author François Mauriac (respectively by their maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother). His sister was actress Pascale Audret (1936–2000) and his niece is actress Julie Dreyfus. Once Aufray's parents divorced, the family left Paris for Sorèze, where he was raised by his mother. During the war, he studied at Sorèze secondary school. In 1945, Aufray joined his father in Madrid, living there for three years. He attended the Lycée Français de Madrid in Madrid, and graduated with his baccalauréat. He then returned to France to start singing in Spanish.

He first began writing songs for French singers. After finishing second in a singing competition, he signed a record deal in 1959 with Eddie Barclay. From there, he went on to co-write and arrange many songs, drawing influence from folk, blues and rock. While supporting Peter, Paul and Mary in New York in 1962, he struck up a friendship with Bob Dylan, who would then visit him in Paris in 1964. Aufray translated many of Dylan's songs into French:[ their appearance on his 1965 album Aufray chante Dylan helped form the tastes of the new French generation.

Aufray represented Luxembourg in the 1964 Eurovision Song Contest, performing ""Dès que le printemps revient"" and finishing fourth.

In 1966, he sang Les Crayons de Couleur in support of Martin Luther King at an anti-racism benefit.

In 1984, he sang a duet with Bob Dylan at a concert in Grenoble,] and performed with him in Paris as well.

Mélanie Marie Georgiades was born on 25 July 1980, in Nicosia, capital of Cyprus. Her mother is French and her father is Greek Cypriot. After her parents separated, she arrived in France with her mother at the age of three. She spent her childhood in Paris, then in the department of Essonne, in Brunoy, until the age of thirteen.

She studied for a while in Igny, in the private Saint-Nicolas college. Later, she moved to Massy then to Orsay in the suburban district of Mondetour, where she spent most of her adolescence. She discovered rap through the album The Chronic (1992) by Dr. Dre and the first song by the group NTM, Je rap (1990) (published on Rapattitude, the first French rap compilation). She chose Diam's as her pseudonym in 1995, a choice she explains as ""I came across the definition of the word diamond and I learned that a diamond can only be broken by another diamond and that it is only made of natural elements"".

In 1995, at the age of fifteen, she attempted suicide. In 2003, she rapped about her past and how, aged 17, she was beaten by her partner in a song called Ma souffrance (My suffering).

She formed a group called Mafia Tres. In 1997, the group released a four title EP with Diam's on two tracks. Diam's became better known, thanks to her appearance in 1997 on Mafia Trece's first album, called Cosa Nostra, and thanks to an appearance on Phonograph with the rap group ATK.

After her separation from Mafia Tres, Diam's released her first album, Premier Mandat in 1999, but it was not a success, selling just 9,000 copies.

In 2001 the song Suzy broadcast on the compilation Original Bombattack on radio Générations 88.2. The song is picked up on the Internet. Suzy came to the attention of Jamel Debbouze who became her friend and mentor. She then made many appearances, and participations on radio shows. She finally prepares her second album, entitled Brut de femme and the record company EMI offers her a contract in April 2002. The project is abandoned following a restructuring of EMI while the two titles Pogo and 1980 are broadcast by a journalist on the Internet before their official release.

She signs on the Hostile label after long negotiations. The tracks are reworked and finally integrated into his second album, Brut de femme. Brut de femme quickly went gold and the single DJ was certified platinum. Diam's won a Victoire de la Musique for the best rap album of the year 2004.

She took a stand against Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party (formerly the National Front), especially in the song ""Marine"", which was released on her DVD Ma Vie/Mon Live in 2004. She also stands against Nicolas Sarkozy, whom she called a demagogue and a fascist in La Boulette and Ma France à moi.

In 2005, she cemented her importance as a songwriter with ""Ma philosophie""—a huge number one hit for Pop Idol star Amel Bent. ...

Jean-Baptiste Maunier was born to Thierry Maunier, a cameraman, and Muriel Maunier. He has a younger brother, Benjamin. His father sang in a well-known church choir (Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint Marc). Jean-Baptiste attended a Roman Catholic school in Lyon, France. He studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York between 2008 and 2009 to perfect his acting and English, returning to France to sing in Les Enfoirés charity concerts.

Maunier gained fame for his starring role in the 2004 French film Les Choristes, in which he plays Pierre Morhange, a delinquent with an exceptional singing voice at the correctional school Fond de L'Étang. Christophe Barratier, the director of Les Choristes, chose Maunier because ""he had the right look"" and a marvellous voice. He was also exceptionally appealing for the role.

Following the release of the film, Maunier and the choir took part in numerous concerts all over the world, including Japan and Canada. In February 2005, he left the choir in order to devote more time to his studies and to his acting career. In April and August 2005, he took part in a four-episode television series for France 2, Le Cri, playing a young steelworker. The series was released in 2006.

Maunier appears in Le Grand Meaulnes (2006) as Francois Seurel. In Piccolo, Saxo et compagnie (2006), an animated film, he lent his voice to the character ""Saxo"". In the summer of 2006, Maunier acted in Hellphone, a full-length film directed by James Huth. In this film, Maunier plays the role of Sid. The film was released in March 2007. In L'Auberge rouge, directed by Gérard Krawczyk (an adaptation of the 1951 version) Maunier stars as Octave. It opened in theaters in France on 5 December 2007. Jean-Baptiste spent a year studying at New York's Lee Strasberg Institute in 2008 to unleash his acting potentials. Staying in the USA allowed him to perfect his English. He returned to France in 2010, and performed in the Enfoirés charity concert of 2010.

Upon entering collège (middle school), Maunier was asked to make a choice between various activities. He chose singing and became a member of Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc (full name is ""La Chorale des Petits Enfants De Saint-Marc""). In the choir, he was tutored by Nicolas Porte. In Les Choristes, the film that made him widely famous for his singing skills, both Maunier's solo and the chorus of ""Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc"" are featured on the original soundtrack.

In 2005, to keep a souvenir of his voice before it broke, Maunier decided to sing with Clemence Saint-Preux and had released the single, Concerto pour deux voix, which was in turn an adaptation of Concerto pour une Voix.

Since 2005 he has participated in Les Enfoirés, an ensemble of notable singers and performers in France that periodically performs charity concerts. He contributed a song named ""Le Monde Qui Est Le Mien"" for the album ""We Love Disney 2"" and also released a single, ""Je Reviens"".

His 2004 film The Last Trapper follows a trapper in Yukon, Canada.

His film, Loup (""Wolf"") was released at the end of 2009 and was presented at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Loup is about the life of the Evens tribe in North Eastern arctic Siberia, in the Verkhoïansk mountain range, who live by raising large herds of reindeer (caribou), which involves protecting them from attacks by wolves.

In 2018, France Nature Environnement formally complained that a film crew overseen by Vanier had disturbed a colony of Greater Flamingoes, by repeatedly flying over them in an ultra-light aircraft, causing many - an estimated 11% of the total breeding population in France - to desert their nests and eggs.

Following her high school studies in literature, theatre and dramatic expression at Saint-Just de Lyon, Florence Foresti entered a school for cinematography at Lyon. After her studies, she appeared in the French television show Thalassa.

At 20, Florence enrolled in a course in classical theatre at Lyon, which she quit after just two days. She had a few other jobs, including working for EDF in Lyon, before finally becoming a computer graphics artist. But she didn't give up on her artistic ambitions, and in 1998 made her début at the café-théâtre Le nOmbril du mOnde (""The navel of the world""), as part of an all woman trio Les Taupes Models (a pun between French ""Model Moles"" and English ""Top Models"") with Céline Ianucci and Cécile Giroud, while simultaneously working as a computer graphics artist. The trio was noticed while touring and Anne Roumanoff proposed to make the act the first part of her show. Florence Foresti's career was launched.

In 2001 her first one-woman show, Manquerait plus qu'elle soit drôle (""The only thing missing is that she be funny"") won the Jury prize at the Antibes festival. Her style bears comparison with that of Muriel Robin and Sylvie Joly, as well as with some of the 'attitude' and voices of Dieudonné M'bala M'bala and Élie Semoun. She appeared in the Stéphane Bern programme 20h 10 pétantes, and then on Laurent Ruquier's On a tout essayé, playing zany characters.

In 2005 she starts her second one-woman show, Florence Foresti fait des sketchs (""Florence Foresti Makes sketches"").

In July 2007, she gave birth to her daughter, Toni . In the wake, she plays in a play L'Abribus with Philippe Elno.

From May 2009 to April 2011 she staged her show MotherFucker. She explained the Anglo-Saxon directness of the title in an interview with Paris Match: ""I asked myself, can one remain a woman, while still being a full-time mother? This question affected me so much that I dubbed my show MotherFucker. And it's a nod to Madonna, my idol. After the birth of her daughter, Lourdes, she appeared in a T-shirt with the word Mother on the front, Fucker on the back. It's so clever, this way of playing with her image, her private life and her playing with words. I stole this.""

From 13 to 23 September 2012, the ""Foresti Party"" begin. Three dates in Lyon (""Foresti Party Lyon"") and five in Paris (""Foresti Party Bercy""). This huge show is broadcast live in cinema 23 September.

On 26 February 2016, she hosted the 41st César Awards.

Astier is most known as the creator, director, writer, editor, composer, and lead actor of the French television series Kaamelott, in which he also plays King Arthur.

Alexandre Astier was born in Lyon on June 16, 1974, to Joëlle Sevilla and Lionnel Astier, both actors and producers mostly in Lyon's theatre scene.

Alexandre Astier studied music at the conservatory and at the American School of Modern Music of Paris. He also studied acting and screenwriting.

Four of Astier's seven children have featured in Kaamelott, and both his parents are main characters in the series. His daughters Ariane and Jeanne Astier play respectively Mehben and Mehgan, the daughters of Karadoc and Maevanwi (in the episodes Pupi and Exiles). His son Neil (who also appears as Karadoc and Mevanwi's son in Pupi) plays young Arthur in the season Book V, and in the final scene of Book VI. His son Ethan plays Arthur's dream heir in Book V. Moreover, the mother of his first five children, Anne-Gaëlle Daval, is head of the costume designs on Kaamelott and the short film Dies Irae.

In 2012, he plays Johann Sebastian Bach in his humorous show ""Que ma joie demeure!"" at the theater.

In 2014, his comic show ""L'Exoconférence"" begins at the theater in September.

Alexandre Astier first got attention from the Lyon's public thanks to the play Le Jour du froment. He also acted in Nous crions grâce, a play written and directed by Jacques Chambon, to whom he gave the role of Merlin in Kaamelott.

In 2001, he was the co-screenwriter and the songwriter of the short movies Soyons sport and Un soupçon fondé sur quelque chose de gras.

In 2002 he was the director of Dies Irae, a 14-minute short movie that is also the first draft of the Kaamelott TV show.

In 2006, he featured in Hey Good Looking!, a French movie by Lisa Azuelos. The same year, he appeared in Asterix at the Olympic Games by Frédéric Forestier and Thomas Langmann, and in Home Sweet Home by Didier Le Pêcheur.

In 2009, he played the role of the ex-husband of Sophie Marceau in the comedy LOL (Laughing Out Loud).

In 2014, he was the co-director and the screenwriter of Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods.

In 2015, he appeared in the film All Three of Us, directed by Kheiron.

In 2018, he wrote an original screenplay for a new Asterix movie: Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion. Like Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods, he co-directed it with Louis Clichy.

Alexandre Astier became famous as the writer, director and actor in the TV show he produced. Kaamelott is inspired by the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This humorous series is broadcast on the French channel M6. The episodes lasted three and a half minutes until 2007. Then, the format changed to seven minutes and finally reached fifty-five minutes per episode in the last season Book VI.

He also composes the music of the series.

He has the ambition to extend the TV show to the cinema as a trilogy, but not before 2012, since Alexandre Astier plans to work as a director on another movie before launching Kaamelott on the big screen. ...

His production style is reminiscent of the electropop film soundtracks of the 1980s. Kavinsky claims that his music is inspired by thousands of movies he watched as a young boy and that he has cherry-picked the best parts from them, consolidating them into one concept. Kavinsky has been compared to many similar French house artists, including Danger and French duo Daft Punk. He achieved greater mainstream recognition after his song ""Nightcall"" was featured in the 2011 film Drive. His debut studio album, OutRun, was released in 2013.

After many years as an actor, Kavinsky's musical career started in 2005 after being inspired by his close friends Jackson Fourgeaud and Quentin Dupieux, the latter director also included Kavinsky's music in his film Steak. During this period Kavinsky produced his first single ""Testarossa Autodrive"" which was inspired by the Testarossa model of Ferrari (one of which Vincent drives in real life). Kavinsky presented the single to Quentin, who in turn presented it to a record label he had access to because of his filming career, and Kavinsky signed with Record Makers.

Kavinsky went on to release three EPs on the Record Makers label: Teddy Boy in 2006, 1986 a year later, and Nightcall with Lovefoxxx of CSS in 2010. Kavinsky toured alongside Daft Punk, The Rapture, Justice, and SebastiAn in 2007.

The SebastiAn remix of ""Testarossa Autodrive"" off the 1986 EP is featured in the video games Grand Theft Auto IV and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. Kavinsky's single ""Nightcall"" was featured in the opening credits of the film Drive, and became a major hit soon after.

In December 2012 he released ""ProtoVision"" and on 25 February 2013 released his debut studio album OutRun.

In November 2021, he returned from his seven year hiatus with the lead single ""Renegade"" from his second studio album Reborn. The song is produced by Gaspard Augé and Victor Le Masne.

Kavinsky is a character made by Vincent Belorgey that has a striking resemblance to Vincent himself but the backstory does not follow anything in Belorgey's history. Kavinsky's story is that after crashing his Testarossa in 1986, he reappeared as a zombie in 2006 to make his own electronic music. Kavinsky's songs help tell his story; Vincent claims in an interview, ""'Night Call' is just about the zombie guy [who] goes to his girlfriend's house and says okay I'm not the same, we need to talk"", referring to Kavinsky going back to find his girlfriend after the crash who has already moved on with her life.

In interview, Kavinsky stated that the entirety of Teddy Boy was written and recorded on a Yamaha DX7, which was famous and notable for the synth-pop sound of the 1980s. Kavinsky originally started making music on an old Apple computer given to him by his friend Mr. Oizo.

Leïla Bekhti was born into an Algerian family from Sidi Bel Abbès in western Algeria, who settled in the Paris region. Born in Issy-les-Moulineaux, Leïla Bekhti grew up in Bagneux. She is the youngest of three children. While a high school student, she regularly bought Casting magazine, with the sole intention of having fun looking for ads that might be of interest to her, without taking any action each time they did. After obtaining a literary baccalaureate (with a theater option) from the Maurice-Genevoix high school in Montrouge, she reluctantly enrolled in a university and took an art therapy course there.[4] She also attended a theater school in Paris for six months, without much regular attendance.

He has released seven studio albums so far, all of them reaching top-five status on the French SNEP chart. GCM started writing and performing a capella at slam events in 2003. Three years later, he signed with Universal's AZ affiliate and released his debut album Midi 20, which became a top-ten selling record of the year in France.

Grand Corps Malade's follow-up album, Enfant de la ville (2008), and third album 3ème temps (2010), were less successful commercially. In 2013, he released his family-inspired Funambule album, while Il nous restera ça (2015) featured 11 collaborations with other musicians. His sixth album, Plan B (2018), reached number two on the SNEP album chart. In 2020, he released Mesdames (Ladies), featuring ten duets with women, which topped the French charts. Its lead single, ""Mais je t'aime"" (But I love you), a duet with Camille Lellouche, became his highest-ranking song on the French singles chart.

GCM's accolades include three Victories of Music awarded by the French Ministry of Culture. His stage name means ""tall, sick body"" in French, a reference to his height (nearly 6'4"" or 1.94m) and to a spinal injury that forces him to walk with a crutch, due to a diving accident in 1997 that initially led doctors to tell him he would never walk again.

Marsaud was born on 31 July 1977 in Le Blanc-Mesnil, Seine-Saint-Denis. His mother was a librarian. His father, Jacques Marsaud, was a regional civil servant, a general commune secretary in Noisy-le-Sec and Saint-Denis, later on a director general of services at Val-de-Marne's departmental council and then at the Plaine Commune agglomeration community (fr: EPT). The family lived in Saint-Denis. Marsaud excelled in his classes, particularly in literary courses; he wrote his first works aged 14–15. But sports won out, and at one point he was simultaneously part of tennis, athletics and basketball clubs; the latter would become his greatest passion. At 17, he was offered a chance to join the training center in Toulouse, but preferred to stay in Saint-Denis. After playing in JSF Nanterre and in Saint-Denis, Marsaud signed with a third-division-level team in Aubervilliers. He earned a DEUG degree, majoring in physical education.

In July 1997, during a sports camp where Marsaud was a supervisor, a diving accident in a swimming pool caused him to displace his spine; he was later told he would never walk again. However, in 1999, after a year of intensive treatment, he regained the ability to walk, although he usually has to use a crutch or cane. Marsaud continued studying and earned a DESS master's degree in sport management. He worked in marketing for the Stade de France between 2001 and 2005, but became disillusioned with the job. ...

She trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After a number of television appearances, in 2007 she starred in the romantic comedy Ce soir, je dors chez toi, directed by Olivier Baroux. A small role that enabled her to be chosen again by the director for his fourth film, Les Tuche, released in 2011.

In this popular comedy, which was a big box-office success (1.5 million tickets sold in France), Sarah Stern plays Stéphanie, Jean-Paul Rouve and Isabelle Nanty's superficial but touching daughter, whose role model is Paris Hilton. The film brought the actress to the attention of the general public.

The sequel, Les Tuche 2 - Le rêve américain (The Tuches 2 - The American Dream), was released in 2016, in which she played the same role, but this time the family moved to the United States. The film's success logically led to an even more lucrative sequel (4.6 million admissions in France), resulting in a third in 2018 (5.7 million admissions!), followed by a fourth opus in 2021.

Meanwhile, Sarah Stern teams up again with Safy Nebbou (after the 2008 drama L'Empreinte de l'ange) for Comme un homme, in which she plays a young English teacher kidnapped by students Emile Berling and Kévin Azaïs.

From this failure, Gillet drew motivation declaring: ""This period of hardship I went through there forced me to reflect and made me mature. I returned to France with the 'niaque': no more dilemmas, I want to play. I changed my life.""

He first appeared on stage in the title role of Caligula, in a celebrated staging by Charles Berling. He made his television debut in 2005, in the role of Hugh Despenser the Younger in the remake miniseries Les Rois maudits, based on the French novel series of the same name by Maurice Druon.

When asked why he chose to write the song Andy, I Love You (French: Andy, Je T'aime) and have him acting in the music video, Michelini declared: ""Because I love Andy. Andy, he's the man I love. This name came to me before I even made music. Andy is a muse: not just mine, a lot of people's muse. For me it was a waste to live with a muse and not do anything with it.""

As a self-taught painter, his work was exhibited internationally. He was the author of several books, including collections of essays and novels. He was also a contributor to France Culture. A communist-turned-libertarian, he was a co-founder of Coopérative des Malassis, an anti-consumerist artists' collective. He was best known for The Red Men, a series of figurative paintings depicting aspects of the Cold War like the May 1968 events, the Vietnam War and Red Scare, and his 150 still lifes, or ""portraits,"" of potatoes.

Henri Cueco was born on 19 October 1929 in Uzerche, Corrèze, a rural part of France. His father, Vicente Cueco, was an immigrant from Spain. His mother was French. He was essentially self-taught, though his father also taught him how to paint from the age of 13.

Cueco began his career as a landscape painter in the 1950s. He became a figurative painter, associated with the school of Nouvelle figuration in 1960s. His artwork was political, and he was a critic of materialism and minimalism. He did paintings of hunting dogs and snakes, followed by 150 still lifes, or ""portraits,"" of potatoes.

In 1969–1970, Cueco co-founded an artists collective called Coopérative des Malassis with Lucien Fleury, Jean-Claude Latil, Michel Parré and Gérard Tisserand. Together, they designed a politically satirical fresco called Le Grand Méchoui in 1972. They designed Qui tue? ou l’affaire Gabrielle Russier in 1973. They also designed Radeau de la Méduse ou la Dérive de la société, a decor on consumerism in the Grand'Place, Grenoble, in 1973–1975. They designed Les affaires reprennent in 1977.

His work was first exhibited at the Salon de la Jeune peinture, followed by the Atelier populaire. In 1970, he exhibited The Red Men, a series of paintings on the Cold War (including the May 1968 events, the Vietnam War and the Red Scare), at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. In 1986, when he exhibited an irreverent portrait of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and Mao Zedong in Beijing, China, he was asked to take it down. The painting included the following quotation by Henri Jeanson: ""Capitalism is the exploitation of men by men. Communism It is the opposite.""

In 1997, Cueco exhibited paintings inspired by Nicolas Poussin and Philippe de Champaigne at the Centre d'art contemporain in Meymac. In 2010, he exhibited nudes in the manner of Ingres at the Musée Ingres in Montauban. He exhibited his work at the Musée d'art et d'archéologie du Périgord in 2014, when he was the guest of honour at the Expoésie Festival. His last exhibition was held at La Maison Rouge in February 2017.

Cueco was the founder of the Association Pays Paysage in Uzerche. He was a contributor to the French radio station France Culture, especially its programmes called Les Papous dans la tête and Les Décraqués. He was the author of several books, including novels and collections of essays. One of his novels was made into a 2007 film directed by Jean Becker, Conversations with My Gardener. ...

Rebecca Marder was born on 10 April 1995 in Paris, France. Marder is the daughter of American musician Marc Marder and French journalist and theatre critic Mathilde de La Bardonnie, who worked for Le Monde and later Libération. Her father is Jewish and her mother Catholic. Marder grew up in France and is a dual citizen of France and the United States.

Between 2008 and 2011, Marder was trained at the Conservatoire à rayonnement communal du 13e arrondissement de Paris. She later studied literature and cinema but interrupted her studies in September 2014 to join the drama school of the National Theatre of Strasbourg, where she studied for ten months.

Marder began her acting career at the age of five. She appeared as Charlotte in the Rodolphe Marconi film Ceci est mon corps (2001). In 2007, she starred in Demandez la permission aux enfants alongside Pascal Légitimus and Sandrine Bonnaire. In 2010, she starred in The Round Up together with Jean Reno and Mélanie Laurent. In 2012, she received the Prix du jeune espoir féminin at the Festival de la fiction TV de La Rochelle for her performance in Alain Tasma's television film Emma.

Marder was discovered by Éric Ruf, general administrator of the Comédie-Française, and chosen after a collective audition. She signed her contract on 19 June 2015, becoming a salaried actress (pensionnaire) of the Comédie-Française troupe. At 20 years old, she became one the youngest pensionnaires in its history, and the youngest of the troupe's then 59 actors. She debuted in the role of Lucietta in Carlo Goldoni's Les Rustres. She regularly appeared on stage there in classical roles, including as Claudine in Molière's George Dandin ou le Mari confondu and La Jalousie du Barbouillé, Atalide in Jean Racine's Bajazet and Hermione in Euripides' Electra and Orestes. In 2022, Marder announced her resignation from the Comédie-Française.

In 2020, Marder was a narrator of the Cambodian documentary film Irradiated, which competed for the Golden Bear in the main competition section at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival. Marder's father composed the film's score. In 2021, Marder appeared in the lead role of Sandrine Kiberlain's feature directorial debut A Radiant Girl, in which she plays a Jewish girl who aspires to become an actress in Paris during the German occupation in 1942. The film premiered in the Critics' Week section of the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Caméra d'Or. For her performance, Marder received nominations for the César Award for Most Promising Actress and Lumières Award for Best Female Revelation.

nm2449290,Anaïs Croze,1976.0,,"actress,writer,composer","tt0922366,tt1987018,tt3283828,tt1418572","Anaïs, full name Anaïs Croze (born August 20, 1976), is a French singer. Her first album, called The Cheap Show, was recorded live in January 2004 and released in 2005. The Cheap Show, a pun on ""peep-show"", is titled such as she is the only musician on stage and makes extensive use of her JamMan pedal.

Anaïs was born in Grenoble and grew up in Marseille; she studied English in Aix-en-Provence. She was the lead singer, composer and lyricist in Opossum from 1999 to late 2002 when the renowned band split after about 200 gigs in France, Switzerland and even Germany, and a seven-track CD called Excuse-moi, j'voulais te d'mander (Sorry, I Wanted To Ask You). Anaïs then went on a successful solo tour in March 2003 with personal songs and characters full of wit and energy. Her show, the Cheap Show, was based on raw rock energy, minimalism and stand-up, a guitar and a loop pedal she used for voice only.

She is also famous for her elastic voice, imitating or simply paying live tributes to well-known and established Francophone singers like Francis Cabrel, Eddy Mitchell, Latin (Shakira), American (N.E.R.D, Kelis), Italian-born Carla Bruni or French Canadian Lynda Lemay, and poking fun, among others, at teenage flirts (Mon cœur, mon amour), Scottish or New Orleans folklore, and various accents ranging from typical Scots to Québécois. Anaïs, who started singing as a child in a choir and has always wanted to be an actress and more recently a film director, could be described as a modern trobairitz inasmuch as she not only sings about herself and the world around her but also acts and plays the parts of caricatured stereotypes of our times. Although her main concerns seem to be love (Christina), she also tackles more serious problems, but on a light and funny note as ever, like racism (Elle sort qu'avec des blacks), depression and solitude (La vie est dure). Her musical style is a happy mixture of folk, pop blues, chanson, rap and even raggamuffin and heavy metal.

Her self-acknowledged influences are quite eclectic: Judy Garland and Bette Midler for their music hall artistry; Jerry Lee Lewis for his rough or/and country music side; Brenda Kahn for derision; Canadian Peaches for minimalism; Chris Isaak and others like Etta James; the Beach Boys; Marie Dubas, a French interwar cabaret entertainer whom she quite resembles and describes as ""a true hurricane of a woman""; and the White Stripes because ""they understood everything about blues and rock"". Although Anaïs did learn musical theory and the violin as a little girl, and later the clarinet, she now confesses she can only play the guitar for her own songs and does not even know the names of chords and tunings! This relative innocence is undeniably part of her charm and talent, and only adds to the magic of her songs. Her irresistible sense of humour and interactive stage performances make Anaïs a promising and original chanteuse, whose self-produced album and refreshing TV appearances have been praised by the public and professionals alike. ...

Kamini's father—Seyolo Zantoko—and his family moved from Zaire to Marly-Gomont, France in 1975. They had difficulty assimilating as the first Black people in town. Kamini grew up there, and by the summer of 2006, was working part-time as a nurse. Seyolo died sometime prior to 2012.

Aspiring to make hip hop music, in 2006 he wrote about Marly-Gomont (""Marly-Gomont""). In his music video, made in late June on a budget of €100 (equivalent to €125 in 2022), he raps about farming and games with his friends and fellow villagers. On 30 August, Kamini uploaded the video and cold-emailed promotions to record companies; instead, a t-shirt retailer shared the link online, and by the end of the day, ""Marly-Gomont"" was a hit. Off the merits of his amateur viral video, Kamini signed with RCA Records on 2 November to publish ""Marly-Gomont"" and two more albums.

In 2012, Kamini wrote and narrated the autobiographical film The African Doctor (French: Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont, lit. 'Welcome to Marly-Gomont') to pay tribute to his father. It was released in 2016, directed by Julien Rambaldi.

He is the son of Greek parents and was raised in Belgium, but also briefly in the state of Wyoming, USA and then Larissa, Greece. He lives in Luxembourg and Paris, France. He holds a BA and an MA in Cultural studies, Comparative Literature, Cinema and an MBA from Paris-Sorbonne University and the University of Luxembourg. As a teenager and during his young adulthood, he was a professional soccer player and had a brief spell in AEK Athens F.C., under Bosnian Serb manager and former player Dušan Bajević. He is the Managing Director of E33Motion Pictures and Film and contributes to Spinal Cord Research. He is fluent in French, English, Greek, and speaks also German, Italian and Luxembourgish. While at the Faculty, he achieved excellence in Fiction Writing under the supervision of French Novelist D. Barbéris. He also reached the highest distinction in Human Rights under the supervision of J.-P.Lehners, UNESCO Chair. Dean Constantin (also credited Dean Constantin Gaigani), gathered first artistic and theatre stage experience while at secondary and undergraduate school in Belgium, also receiving music and vocal coaching until 1997 at the Conservatoire under the direction of Prof. Ramonfosse. His artistic career was cut abruptly in 1997 following a serious accident during an academic and artistic trip in the South of France. Left with Tetraplegia, he was far from convinced that an acting career would ever be possible. After an unexpected full recovery, while continuing to gather acting experience in major features in Europe he also enrolled in the Los Angeles Acting Academy in California, working with American actress Sydney Walsh, confirming his resolve to increase his skills and with the goal of making a decent living out of acting, writing and directing. After some small parts in French, German, Luxembourgish and American productions such as De-Lovely, directed by Irwin Winkler, starring Kevin Klein, Jonathan Pryce, Ashley Judd, and a brief appearance in Gilles' Wife by director Frederic Fonteyne, starring Emmanuelle Devos and Clovis Cornillac, he had the opportunity to be auditioned for the Merchant of Venice by director Michael Radford in the role of Leonardo, providing him with a chance to act side by side with Joseph Fiennes, Al Pacino, and Jeremy Irons. With a remarkable audition and a contract signed at hand, he was mysteriously dropped by a co-production and the role was finally given to Tony Schiena. After being offered contract compensation, he gently refused any cent and spent the next six months isolated, focusing on his screenplays and music compositions. He thus continued with a brief appearance as a Journalist in the feature Tempesta by Tim Disney with Malcolm McDowell and Rutger Hauer. Finally, he spent valuable time on European stages before moving to Ireland and focus on his writings. From 2012 to 2013, he has worked with famous directors, such as Eric Rochant, in the new thriller Möbius and made a break through with stars such as Tim Roth, Cecile de France, Jean Dujardin, and John Lynch.  Most recently, co-starred in the feature of director Nicolas Bary, The Scapegoat, original title Au bonheur des ogres, with Berenice Bejo, Emir Kusturica, Guillaume de Tonquedec, and R.Personnaz.",1977-09-30,,1154239.0,Acting,Belgium,0.589,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500//aHppSogWv8qWfMaRZUmd3FlK5jL.jpg

Sattouf is best known for his award-winning graphic memoir hexalogy L'Arabe du futur (The Arab of the Future) and for his award-winning film Les Beaux Gosses (The French Kissers). He also worked for the satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo for ten years, from 2004 to mid-2014, publishing drawing boards of one of his major works La vie secrète des jeunes.

Riad Sattouf was born in Paris, to a Syrian father and French mother, and spent his childhood in Libya and Syria, then returned to France to spend his teenage years in Brittany, studying in Rennes. An avid reader of cartoon books and periodicals, sent to him by his grandmother, he was fascinated by them. Although he was studying to become a pilot, he applied to study at École Pivaut and then Gobelins L'Ecole de L'Image to study animation. The famous cartoonist Olivier Vatine noticed his talent and introduced him to Guy Delcourt, the owner of Delcourt, a publisher specializing in cartoons. Delcourt published Sattouf's first book Petit Verglas based on a story line by Éric Corbeyran.

In a unique personal and humorous style, he narrated his own adolescent life observations in Manuel du puceau and Ma Circoncision published by Bréal Jeunesse Publishing House owned by Joann Sfar. The books were later reprinted by L'Association Publishing House. In Ma circoncision, he denounced circumcision as a cruel and absurd act, superimposed on the context of the socio-political life in his ancestral Syria in the 1980s.

He then published the Jérémie series in the cartoon collection Poisson Pilote published by Dargaud, resulting in three books of the series. Jérémie is the story of a young sentimental and unstable youth growing to adulthood and is very autobiographical. It also appeared in No sex in New York in 2004 on the initiative of the French left-wing daily Libération.

In 2005 he published Retour au collège, an observational study of adolescents in a Parisian middle school, which was a big success. Meanwhile, Sattouf developed the fictional character Pascal Brutal, an embodiment of pure virility. The comedic Pascal Brutal series imagines France of the near-future as an anarchic, neoliberal dystopia where the hero's outlandish machismo is given free rein.

From 2004 to 2014, he published a weekly strip in the satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo entitled ""La vie secrète des jeunes"", recounting anecdotal observations of young people in public places. He likened the strip to a fly-on-the-wall nature documentary, and rendered the speech of his subjects with careful attention to sociolinguistic variation. The strips have been republished in three volumes, one in 2007, the second in 2010 and the last one in 2013. In late 2014, he left Charlie Hebdo and moved to Le Nouvel Obs, a weekly magazine, with a new strip called Les cahiers d'Esther (Esther's notebooks), based on true stories told to him by Esther A., a girl who was 9 years old when the strip started.

Sattouf also experimented with film dubbing by giving his voice to a cartoon character in Petit Vampire designed by his friend, cartoonist Joann Sfar. ...

Izïa was born in Paris on 24 September 1990 to Jacques Higelin, a famous French singer of Belgian and Alsatian descent, and Aziza Zakine, a dancer and chorist of Tunisian descent. She comes from a family of artists; beside her father and mother, her two half brothers are Arthur H and Kên Higelin. She was influenced by music from an early age when her father introduced her to jazz and British pop music. At the age of seven, she formed a duo with her father; she provided the vocals while he played piano.

When she was 13 Izïa started to take an interest in rock bands such as Nirvana and Led Zeppelin. At this time, she wrote her first song, titled ""Hey Bitch"", which later featured on her debut album.

A year later she met Caravan Palace bassist Antoine Toustou through her parents and the pair played their first live show in 2004. Six months later, her backing group was expanded to three people when Izïa and Toustou were joined by Sébastien Hoog and Vincent Polycarpe. She left school at the age of 15 in order to concentrate on a career in music.

In 2006, Izïa released her first extended play and the following year she opened for Iggy & the Stooges at the Printemps de Bourges music festival. She consequently embarked on a tour of France, which consisted of over thirty dates. On 8 June 2009, her eponymous debut studio album, Izia was released in France. In some reviews, the album garnered comparisons to Janis Joplin. The album performed reasonably well in the French albums chart, achieving a peak position of #31 and staying in the top 100 for 17 consecutive weeks.

Izïa has since released three more albums that reached the charts in France: So Much Trouble (2011), La Vague (2015), and Citadelle (2019). In 2021, Izïa contributed a cover of the Metallica song ""My Friend of Misery"" to the charity tribute album The Metallica Blacklist.

Izïa made her film debut in 2012, appearing in the film Bad Girl under her full name, Izia Higelin. She was nominated for several awards for her performance in the film, including the César Award for Most Promising Actress. Since then she has continued to act sporadically, appearing in the 2015 film Summertime and playing Camille Claudel in the 2017 film Rodin.

She is known for her roles in the films Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019) and School's Out (2018). She made her directorial debut with The Hill Where Lionesses Roar (2020).

Bajrami's family is from Pleshina, a village in the Ferizaj District of Kosovo. When she was seven, the family moved to Créteil, just south of Paris. She first became interested in acting after watching Nicolas Bary's 2008 adaption of Trouble at Timpetill, based on the novel by Henry Winterfeld.

Bajrami's first role was in the 2011 television film Adèle's Choice by Olivier Guignard, where she played an 8-year-old Albanian student whose family was threatened with expulsion. This student finds support from her teacher, played by Miou-Miou. Bajrami had a small role in the 2014 short film 14 Million Screams by Lisa Azuelos. She played the title role in the TV film Marion by Bourlem Guerdjou. Marion was adapted from the eponymous book by Nora Fraisse retracing the Marion Fraisse affair in which a schoolgirl committed suicide following harassment by her fellow students, and first aired on France 3 on September 27, 2016. In an interview with Le Monde, Bajrami reflected that this was the first role in which she felt creative control. She read the book and met with the mother of Marion Fraisse.

Bajrami starred in two more short films: Two Youths Died by Tomasso Usberti, which won third prize from the Cinéfondation at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017, and the 2018 film After the Night by Valentin Plisson and Maxime Roux.

She played the role of Apolline, the ringleader of a group of six intellectually gifted students facing off against their substitute teacher (played by Laurent Lafitte) in Sébastien Marnier's 2019 film School's Out, adapted from the eponymous novel by Christophe Dufossé. She was praised for her portrayal of Apolline, with EJ Oakley of The Panoptic stating that ""Luana Bajrami is particularly menacing as the verbose and morose Apolline"".

Bajrami was praised for her portrayal of Sophie in the 2019 independent French film Portrait of a Lady on Fire. That same year, she played the role of Emma in Cedric Khan's Happy Birthday, which focused on a dysfunctional family reunion.

She is best known for being a semi-finalist in the second season of The Voice: la plus belle voix in France with Louis Bertignac as a coach. She later got a role in La Famille Bélier which won her a César Award.

Anne Peichert grew up in the French department of Pas-de-Calais, with her four sisters and her only brother Bach. Louane's father, Jean-Pierre Peichert, was French, son of a Polish mother and German father. Her mother, Isabel Pinto dos Santos, was Portuguese, the daughter of a Portuguese father and a Brazilian mother.

In 2008, Louane Emera took part in L'École des stars, a French music competition broadcast on channel Direct 8.

Louane is an orphan - her rendition of ""Imagine"" was dedicated to her father who had died just three months prior to her appearance in The Voice and her mother died in 2014 after a lengthy illness. Louane Emera said that her parents often had to punish her due to her hyperactivity, but that she has learned a lot about discipline from them and that they always treated her with love. She regularly gives them credit for her success.

In 2013, her first real breakthrough came with her taking part in The Voice: la plus belle voix's second season. She auditioned with ""Un homme heureux"" by William Sheller with all four coaches Florent Pagny, Jenifer, Louis Bertignac and Garou turning their chairs. She opted to be part of Team Louis Bertignac. Her ""blind audition"" episode was broadcast on 16 February 2013.

23 March 2013, during the Musical Battles round, she was picked by Bertignac against her rival Diana Espir, after both interpreted ""Torn"" by Natalie Imbruglia. During the live rounds, she sang ""Les moulins de mon cœur"" by Michel Legrand and was saved by public vote. On 27 April 2013 she performed ""Call Me Maybe"" by Carly Rae Jepsen and was saved by her mentor coach to go through. With Lennon's ""Imagine"" dedicated to her deceased father, she was saved yet again by public vote. But her luck ended in the semi-finals after her rendition of ""Quelqu'un m'a dit"" by Carla Bruni. She had a cumulative score of 74 while the other Team Bertignac semi-finalist Loïs had a composite score of 76. Accordingly, Louane was eliminated finishing 5th to 8th.

All semi-finalists and finalists, including Louane, took part in an after-season tour throughout France.

After her appearance in The Voice, Éric Lartigau noticed her and cast her for his movie La Famille Bélier in which she played the role of Paula, a 16-year-old who is the only hearing person in a family of deaf people. The character sings a number of Michel Sardou songs, most notably ""Je vole"". As a result, she won the ""Most Promising Actresses"" at the 40th ceremony of the Césars.

On 5 February 2015, she served as an opening act for Jessie J's showcase in Paris.

Her debut studio album, Chambre 12, was released on 2 March 2015, to great success. Her single ""Avenir"" also topped the French charts.

In 2017, she provided vocals for the track, ""It Won't Kill Ya,"" from The Chainsmokers' debut album, Memories...Do Not Open.

She is well known for her roles in musicals, including 1789: Les Amants de la Bastille in the role of Olympe, and La Légende du roi Arthur in the role of Reine Guenièvre.

Camille Lou was born 22 May 1992 in Bersillies, near Maubeuge. Her father was a singer and guitarist for the group Paradoxe, thus she and her two older sisters were exposed to music at a young age, each later learning to play an instrument, Camille played the violin. At the age of twelve, she won a local singing competition, les Voix de Noël, in Hautmont. She attended lycée Notre-Dame de Grâce à Maubeuge. After having obtained her baccalaureate she attended the University of Valenciennes.

In January 2010, with the help of her guitar teacher at the time, Camille began her solo career under the pseudonym Jimmie. She began to sing and completed her first album La Grande Aventure, in pop-folk style. She made many appearances under her pseudonym, notably for her work on Coeur de Pirate's album in March 2010.

On 15 September 2017, she released the single ""Self Control"".

Being friends with fellow singers Nuno Resende and Merwan Rim, she was encouraged by the latter to sing in front of Dove Attia, a musical producer with whom Resende and Rim had both worked on Mozart, l'opéra rock. While attending a Parisian restaurant one evening, Camille and her family by chance were there at the same time as musical producer Dove Attia and singers from Mozart, l'opéra rock. Camille was encouraged by Rim to sing Falling Slowly from the film Once in front of Attia. Despite Camille having little prior experience in musical theatre, Attia was impressed and invited Camille to audition for his next musical. She sang a collection of songs from Mozart, l'opéra rock among others and finally in 2011, she won the role of Olympe, servant of Marie Antoinette in the musical 1789: Les Amants de la Bastille. Camille starred in the role for two runs of the show at the Palais des Sports in Paris as well as the 2012 tour around the country.

In 2014, Dove Attia proposed the role of Guenièvre (Guinivere) to Camille in his new musical, La Légende du roi Arthur, also featuring Florent Mothe's Arthur and Zaho's Morgane (Morgana). The musical was first performed on 17 September 2015 at Palais des congrès de Paris and toured France in 2016. Camille appears in her role in music videos for ""Mon combat (Tir Nam Beo)"", ""Quelque chose de magique"", and ""Auprès d'un autre"" (the latter also features peaks at the activity behind the scenes).

In December 2014, she recorded a song for the album We Love Disney with Garou, a cover of the song ""Beauty and the Beast"" from the Disney film of the same name.

She participated in the album Forever Gentlemen Volume 2 singing a cover of ""La soleil de ma vie"" with Amir.

She also was featured in a photoshoot for Tara Jarmon.

Following 1789: Les Amants de la Bastille, she became dedicated to her solo projects but also equally to her band composed of five singers that performed in Les Chansons d'abord at the side of Natasha St-Pier, broadcast each Sunday at 5 pm on France 3.

Camille was cast as Hélène Barignet in Emmanuel Fricero's film Marché noir. ...

His career began with the release of two EPs in 2013 and 2014, titled Bruxelles c'est devenu la jungle and Famille nombreuse. In 2016, his album EP Morale was released. In 2017 and 2018, two more albums were released: Morale 2 and his reissue Morale 2 luxe (released from his collaboration with producer Le Motel). In 2019, he released an album titled Chocolat and another album in 2022 titled Tout Peut Arriver. He has close connections with Belgian band L'Or du Commun, hip hop duo Caballero & JeanJass, and French rapper Lomepal.

Roméo Van Laeken was born on 13 December 1992 in Uccle, Belgium, from a family of French-speaking Belgian artists. His father Serge Van Laeken, better known as Marka, is a singer and songwriter. His mother Laurence Bibot is a comedian, and his younger sister Angèle is an international singer-songwriter. Interested in music since his youth, he developed a style distinct from that of other members of his family. Roméo Elvis was raised in Linkebeek, in the southern suburbs of Brussels, and later relocated to Forest.

After primary school, he continued his secondary studies at Saint-Luc Tournai Institute where he learned to paint and draw. It was during this time that Elvis began rapping with his friends. His artistic training continued at ESA 75, in Brussels, where he studied photo-journalism. While continuing to practice rap, he became close to members of L'Or du Commun.

While his first EPs were being released, Roméo Elvis was working as a cashier at the supermarket chain Carrefour. Despite his success, he was not able to earn enough money from rapping alone. Shortly before the release of the album Bruxelles arrive, he quit his job and devoted himself solely to music. In 2016, Elvis and producer Le Motel released the EP Morale, which was a musical breakthrough for Elvis in Belgium and in France. Morale was followed in March 2017 by the studio album Morale 2, which was reissued in February 2018 as the double record Morale 2luxe.

In 2019, Elvis collaborated with French sportswear brand Lacoste to create a limited collection. That same year, he released his first solo album Chocolat, which features guest appearances from Matthieu Chedid and Damon Albarn.

In 2020, Elvis was the subject of allegations of sexual assault on social networks which led to Elvis issuing a public statement in which he apologized for what he described as ""inappropriate"" behavior. Although no complaints were filed against him, several brands and artists ended their collaboration with Elvis.

In 2022, Elvis released his second solo album Tout peut arriver.  The musical style of Roméo Elvis has evolved with the progression of his projects. While developing old-school instrumentals and a flow with similar ambiance to his first two EPs, his collaboration with the producer Le Motel on Morale and Morale 2 profoundly changed his style. He currently allows himself to make more refrains and add electronic instrumentals, and in accord with the jazz of Le Motel, giving them a more current tone. ...
